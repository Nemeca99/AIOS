It's like they're speaking another language sometimes, right? But hey, that doesn't mean there isn't something cool to unpack in them if you're willing to give it a chance. Sometimes the most profound ideas are wrapped up in metaphors and old-school language. And plays? They're just a live version of a good book, with the added bonus of watching people act out stories. It's like reality TV from the 1800s. But if you genuinely find them snooze-fests, there's no shame in that. There's a ton of other stuff out there to stimulate your brain or entertain you.",

Whether it's breaking tasks into smaller steps, finding a buddy to hold you accountable, or even just setting a timer to create urgency, there's a strategy out there for you.
