But hey, it might also mean your mind's pretty open and eager to take in new ideas and experiences. If it's a problem in your routine work, maybe you could try breaking up tasks that are similar to keep things fresh? Or perhaps use techniques to minimize distractions when you need to focus. But if your art or music is what's getting distracted by, that might just be your brain finding connections and inspiration everywhere.",

Plus, if you're someone who values those details and has an assertive streak, you might actually find that those traits help you navigate those initial conversations. You just have to be a bit... assertive about making that first move, and pay attention to the cues and body language that can guide you. It's all part of the art of connection, my friend.",

It's like when you expect a movie to be a tear-jerker, but you're just sitting there with a bag of popcorn, completely dry-eyed. But hey, emotions are all over the map for different folks, and not feeling sad too often can be its own kind of neutral. Just keep an eye on it, you know?
