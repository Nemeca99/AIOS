It's great that you can connect with others so naturally. Just be careful not to spread yourself too thin - even social butterflies need their alone time sometimes.",

It keeps us on our toes, prepared for stuff. The trick is not to let it consume you. Easier said than done, I know.\n\nYou ever just want to tell your brain to take a freakin' break? Like, \"Hey, mind, chill out for five minutes!\" Yeah, me too. But hey, at least we're not boring, right? We've got drama in our heads 24/7.",
