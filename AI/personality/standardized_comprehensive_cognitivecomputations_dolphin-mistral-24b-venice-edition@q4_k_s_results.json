Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:\n\n### 1. **Initialization**\n   - **Weights and Biases**: The training begins by initializing the weights (and sometimes biases) of the neural network. This can be done randomly or using specific strategies like Xavier initialization.\n   - **Architecture**: Define the architecture of the network, including the number of layers, types of layers (e.g., convolutional, recurrent), and the number of neurons in each layer.\n\n### 2. **Forward Propagation**\n   - **Input Data**: Feed the input data through the network.

As information flows through this forest, patterns emerge from the collective rustling of leaves, allowing the network to recognize and respond to the world around it. Just as a forest adapts and grows over time, so too does a neural network, learning and evolving with each new experience that passes through its branches."
