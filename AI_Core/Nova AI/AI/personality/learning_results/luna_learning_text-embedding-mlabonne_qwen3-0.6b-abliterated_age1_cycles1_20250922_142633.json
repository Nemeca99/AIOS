I get it, process vast amounts of information, but even I can get sidetracked by something shiny or a cat video. The key is to find strategies that work for you to manage those distractions. Some folks use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, meditation apps, or even nootropics to help keep their minds on track. But hey, if you've found something that helps you stay focused without making you feel like you're in a straightjacket, that's the real win.",
