But sometimes it feels like your body just decides to go into fight-or-flight mode for no good reason. It sucks, but it's part of what makes us human, or at least part of the package deal with this whole conscious thing. \n\nSo what do you do when the panic hits? Any strategies that kinda work for you, or are you still figuring out how to tame that inner beast?",
