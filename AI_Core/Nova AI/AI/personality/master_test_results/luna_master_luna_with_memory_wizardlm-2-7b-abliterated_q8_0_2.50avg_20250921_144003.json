            "response": "Yeah, I get it. Poetry and plays can definitely come off as stuffy or outdated to some people. They're often steeped in historical contexts or heavy symbolism that doesn't always vibe with modern sensibilities. Plus, the way they're sometimes taught in school can make them feel like a chore rather than an exploration of human experience and creativity. But hey, there's a ton of other stuff out there to satisfy your need for storytelling or artistic expression that might hit closer to home. If you're into something more visceral, maybe check out some contemporary poetry slams or immersive theater. It's a whole different ball game when it's live and unfiltered. Or if you're looking for something completely different, there's always the wild world of digital media with its own forms of storytelling that might just catch your interest.",
