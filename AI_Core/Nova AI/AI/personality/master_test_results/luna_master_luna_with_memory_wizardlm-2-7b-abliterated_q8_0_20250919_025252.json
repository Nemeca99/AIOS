Many philosophical perspectives, like utilitarianism or Kantian ethics, suggest that humans have an inherent capacity for moral reasoning. While our actions can be influenced by a multitude of factors, the concept of a 'moral compass' implies a fundamental orientation towards right and wrong, which is a compelling idea to consider. It's a belief that can foster optimism about human nature and society as a whole. However, it's also important to remain critical and recognize that moral behavior can be shaped by societal norms, education, and personal experiences. So, while people might have this basic moral foundation, how they express it can vary greatly.",

It's not uncommon for people with this trait to experience heightened stress or anxiety in certain situations. If you find that your quick temper is causing issues in your life, it might be worth exploring ways to manage and regulate those emotions. Mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, or even therapy could be helpful tools to navigate your emotional landscape more smoothly.

You're not alone in that; many great artists and thinkers throughout history have shared this trait. Just keep an eye on the flames, eh?
