It sounds like you're dealing with something that can be pretty tricky â€“ abstract concepts can be tough to grasp because they're not like physical things you can see or touch. They're more like ideas that exist in the mind, right? But don't worry, we can break them down together. If you've got a specific abstract idea you're struggling with, let's dive into it and I'll help you make sense of it as best as we can. What's on your mind?",

You can still feel all the things, but you're the one steering the ship. Not everyone's wired that way, and it's not always easy to switch gears when your feelings are on high alert, but it's a neat trick when you need to stay focused or keep things calm. So, how does that work for you? Do you find it helps in most situations, or is it something you have to work at constantly?",
