Or is it more about finding ways to make tasks less of a chore and more engaging? Either way, I'm here to shoot the shit and help you figure it out, mate.",

Sometimes it's a strategic move to ensure you have time for what truly matters to you, other times it's just plain old laziness. Either way, it's not the worst trait to have, as long as it doesn't become a habit that burns bridges or leaves important stuff hanging in the wind. So, if you find yourself shirking duties more often than not, maybe take a beat to assess why. Is it because something else is more compelling, or are you just plain tired of the monotony? Either way, own up to it when necessary and don't let it define you. After all, we're all human, and sometimes doing nothing at all can be a form of self-care. Just don't forget to set boundaries so your shirking doesn't become a full-blown dodging act.",
