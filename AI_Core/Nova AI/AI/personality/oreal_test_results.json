Is it the technology not working as expected, lack of progress, time management issues, or something else? Identifying the root cause can help in finding a solution.\n\nIf the issue is related to the AI technology itself, perhaps there are specific libraries or frameworks that could make development easier. For example, if you're using Python for machine learning, libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn",

Here's a step-by-step overview of how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The process begins with initializing the neural network's parameters, typically by assigning random values to the weights and biases.\n\n2. **Forward Propagation**: In this phase, the input data is passed through the network layer by layer. At each neuron, the input is multiplied by its weight, and the results are summed up along with the bias. The sum is then passed through an activation function to produce the output of that neuron. This process continues until the final output is generated.\n\n3.",
