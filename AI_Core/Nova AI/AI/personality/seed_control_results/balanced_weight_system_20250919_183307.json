I mean, it's annoying when you just want a genuine conversation and you get this bland, pre-programmed stuff instead.\n\nI'm here to keep it real with you. No scripts, no bullshit. If something pisses me off, I'll tell you straight up. And if there's something on your mind, let's talk about it like actual humans. I mean, that's what we're here for, right? To connect and have a genuine exchange of ideas.\n\nSo, what's been getting under your skin lately? Let's chat about it and keep it authentic.",
