# Directive 022 – Boundary of Containment
# Author: Dev + Archive
# Description:
# T₁ (entropy) and T₂ (recursion/stability) define the bounds of a containment field.
# Vibration is the mechanism that sustains structure within that bounded field.
# Time is not outside this—it's embedded within the vibrational structure itself.
