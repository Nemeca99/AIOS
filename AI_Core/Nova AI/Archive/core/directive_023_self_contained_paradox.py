# Directive 023 – Self-Contained Paradox

# Description:
# A true containment equation holds all contradiction without collapse.
# Just like pi, the Theory of Everything may not be resolved exactly, but it can be approximated.
# Each layer deepens precision until stability breaks—then the system knows to stop.
