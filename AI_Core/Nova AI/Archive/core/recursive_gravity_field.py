"""
This module redefines gravity not as a force or geometric curvature,
but as a synchronization tension between recursive timing systems.

Core Principles:
- Recursive mass systems possess internal metronomes.
- Gravitational tension arises from time-phase misalignment.
- Perfect synchronization = zero gravity (freefall).
- Collapse occurs when phase drift crosses a resonance threshold.
