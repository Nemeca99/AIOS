## AIOS Clean: A Modular Operating System for Large Language Models with Complete Provenance Tracking

We present AIOS Clean, a modular operating system architecture for large language models that enables runtime model swapping, tier-based routing, and speculative decoding across multiple architectures (LLaMA, Qwen, Liquid). Our system provides complete provenance tracking and deterministic reproducibility, achieving cross-architecture portability while maintaining performance characteristics.

**Key Contributions:**
- **OS-level modularity**: Nine self-contained cores with schema-validated configurations and runtime model switching
- **Survival-economy cognition shaping**: Tier-based routing (trivial→1B embedder, moderate/high→7B main) with speculative dual-decoding
- **Complete provenance framework**: Every request stamped with models, quantization, hashes, environment, git_rev, and performance metrics
- **Publication-ready pipeline**: Automated workflow from experiments → NDJSON provenance → publication tables → Methods+Results sections

**Results**: Tier routing achieves 100% accuracy on trivial prompts and ≥90% on complex queries across architectures. Speculative decoding shows architecture-dependent acceptance rates (LLaMA: 65%, Qwen: 36%, Liquid: TBD). Latency measurements demonstrate consistent performance across CARMA and Simple_RAG backends.

**Reproducibility**: All results generated under `execution_mode=real` with deterministic seeds, complete environment tracking, and machine-verifiable provenance logs. The system eliminates "trust me" papers by providing complete traceability from data collection to publication-ready results.
