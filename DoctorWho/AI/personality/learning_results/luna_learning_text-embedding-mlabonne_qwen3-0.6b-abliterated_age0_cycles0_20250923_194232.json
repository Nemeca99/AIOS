They provide structure and can help reduce stress by giving you a clear plan for the day or week. But don't forget to leave some room for spontaneityâ€”it keeps life interesting. And hey, if your schedule feels too rigid, it's okay to bend the rules a bit. After all, you're in charge of your own time.",
