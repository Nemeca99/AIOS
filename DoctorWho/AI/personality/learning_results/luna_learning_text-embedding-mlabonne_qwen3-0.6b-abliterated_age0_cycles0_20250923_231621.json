Extraversion ain't for everyone, right? It's all about finding your own vibe where you can recharge, whether it's in the quiet corners of a library or out in nature, away from the herd. Preferring solitude has its perks too, like deep thinking time and not having to share your snacks. How do you usually unwind when you're feeling overwhelmed by too much social energy?",
