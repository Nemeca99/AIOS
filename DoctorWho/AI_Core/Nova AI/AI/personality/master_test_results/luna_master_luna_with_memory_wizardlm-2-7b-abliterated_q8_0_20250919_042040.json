Just remember, if it starts getting in the way of reality, you might want to channel that energy into something productive\u2014like writing a novel or inventing the next big thing. Or, hey, maybe just use it to come up with some killer fantasy scenarios. Imagination's got its perks, no doubt about that.",

It's like having your own personal bubble that not everyone gets to pop. Not my style, but hey, different strokes for different folks. If you're feeling the need to warm up or open up a bit, I'm here. Just throwing that out there.",

But hey, it's part of who we are, right? It keeps things interesting, I guess. Just gotta find the right people who can handle your mood swings, or better yet, learn to ride the waves yourself.
