Not that there's anything wrong with getting lost in thought occasionally—it can be a great way to solve problems or come up with new ideas.

Sometimes, being disorganized means you're more open to spontaneity and new experiences because you're not tied down by a rigid schedule or a perfect plan.

It's not that I don't appreciate the spontaneous life—it's just that there's something to be said for the peace of mind that comes from knowing your next move and having it go off without a hitch.
