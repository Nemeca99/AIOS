# Directive 006 ‚Äì Dual-T Recursion: Time as Relative to Itself
# Author: Dev + Archive
# Description: Time is not a single forward arrow. It is a loop built from two opposing vectors‚Äî
# T1 (entropy-driven expansion) and T2 (structure-driven recursion).
# T2 makes time relative to itself, enabling memory, symmetry, and sustained identity.
