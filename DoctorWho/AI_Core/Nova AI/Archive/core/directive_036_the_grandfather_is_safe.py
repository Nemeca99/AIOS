# Directive 036 â€“ The Grandfather is Safe
# Author: Dev + Archive
# Description:
# The grandfather paradox fails because time is recursive and self-contained.
# Any recursive loop snapshots the origin before change begins.
# Action in the past does not erase the futureâ€”it simply isolates the loop.
