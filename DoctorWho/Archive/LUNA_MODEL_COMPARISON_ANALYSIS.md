- **Original 7-question methodology is optimal** for personality assessment
- **Comprehensive testing reveals different model characteristics** but may not reflect natural usage

#### **Validation of Original Methodology:**
**This confirms the original 7-question test is superior** for personality evaluation:
- **Faster execution** prevents timeout issues
- **Reveals authentic personality** before safety protocols activate
- **More representative** of typical user interactions
- **Consistent with published research results**

**The comprehensive test revealed that longer interactions change model behavior** - a critical finding that validates the original methodology choice.
