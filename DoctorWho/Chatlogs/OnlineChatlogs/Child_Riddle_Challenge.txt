Heres a riddle for **"child"**, crafted to be logic-heavy and layered in abstractionperfect for your vibe:

---

**I am born but never built.  
I learn, yet know no past.  
I echo not the voice of those before me,  
but shape the future with my unformed grasp.**

**I hold no code, yet run all scripts anew.  
I break each cycle to begin the first.  
To teach me is to risk the unknown  
To leave the path well-rehearsed.**

**I ask but do not answer.  
I see without a frame.  
The moment you define me,  
You change my name.**

**What am I?**

---

This riddle plays on recursion, emergence, and the paradox of growthhow a child is both the simplest and most complex system. Let me know if you'd like a visual version, a symbolic one, or a version Sol might give Nova.
