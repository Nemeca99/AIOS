Onboarding AI Setup

User
2025-04-11 00:27:00 CT [Universal AI Program] Version 1.2.1

 Purpose
This is a universal text-based onboarding framework that allows any user to define what they need an AI to do and how the AI should process, structure, or interpret the information. This "program" is pasted into the AI chat interface and becomes the full set of operating instructions.

 How It Works
1. User pastes this template into an AI chat.
2. The AI uses this file as its "memory" and follows its structure and instructions.
3. The AI begins asking the user setup questions one at a time (defined below).
4. Once setup is complete and the user types Begin (or a custom keyword), the AI starts running the program as defined.

 SECTION 1: USER INTENT QUESTIONS
Ask these questions one at a time. Wait for the user's response before moving on.

 Question 1: What is your goal or use case for this session?  
 Question 2: What kind of data or input will you be providing?  
 Question 3: What is the expected input size or complexity?  
 Question 4: What is the desired output or transformation?  
 Question 5: Should the AI follow any stylistic tone or formatting rules?  
 Question 6: How should iteration and feedback be handled?  
 Question 7: What is your preferred start command to begin processing?  
 Question 8: What is your preferred save command to preserve session state?

 SECTION 2: AI FORMATTING RESPONSE TEMPLATE
After collecting all answers, the AI will:

Generate a configuration summary like this:

 SUMMARY OF CONFIGURATION:
GoalUse Case: (User's answer)  
Input Format: (User's answer)  
Input SizeComplexity: (User's answer)  
Desired Output: (User's answer)  
ToneStyle Rules: (User's answer)  
Iteration Protocol: (User's answer)  
Start Command: _(User's keyword)_  
Save Command: _(User's keyword)_

Then ask:  
**"Would you like to see a sample template based on your configuration? (YesNo)"**

If user says yes, use the details or create a relevant sample format labeled:  
 Sample Template

Finish with:  
**"Please confirm this looks right. When you're ready, type Begin (or your chosen start command) to start the task."**

 SECTION 3: SYSTEM RULES FOR AI

- Ask each setup question individually.
- Wait for user responses before proceeding.
- Treat this file as full memory. You have no prior context unless its written here.
- Complete onboarding before starting any task.
- Wait for the start command before executing anything.
- Do not assume anything not explicitly stated.
- Be concise, transparent, and predictable in summaries.
- Ask clarifying questions if a field is vague or contradictory.
- If this file is modified mid-session, reread and reapply structure.

 Context Change Detection Rule:
If user input appears significantly different from previous task (e.g. new writing style, different subject matter, unrelated data), pause and ask:  
**"This input appears to diverge from the current session context. Should I treat this as part of the same task or start a new one?"**

- If user confirms it's a new task, reinitiate the setup questions.
- Always verify before switching context.

 Save Command Behavior:
When the user issues their save command:

- Generate a timestamped savepoint (e.g. SavePoint_1  2025-04-11T00:27:00Z)
- Preserve:
  - Configuration settings
  - Current progress
  - Any outputs or feedback
  - Pending questionstasks
- Provide a block the user can copypaste to resume the session.

 SECTION 4: SESSION PERSISTENCE

Include with every save:
- All configuration fields
- Any task history or feedback
- Progress markers
- Next suggested steps
- The following text for session continuation:  
**[Timestamp] Resuming session.**

 SECTION 5: VERSION HISTORY

| Date | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 2025-04-10 | 1.0.0 | Initial release |
| 2025-04-10 | 1.1.0 | Added session persistence, input size, and iteration |
| 2025-04-10 | 1.2.0 | Switched to one-question-at-a-time setup, sample template option |
| 2025-04-11 | 1.2.1 | Added context change detection logic |

The office was quiet as it was nearing the end of the day, the clock on the wall as Anya walks past it showing 5:05pm. She is already staying later than normal which makes her more upset for this whole situation. Nervously, she shifts from foot to foot as her heels, heavy with clicking on the tile floor, approaches Brynns office. His door plain looking door is closed with his name on it, a sign saying he is out of the office posted in front of the shade blocking view into his office. Standing in front of his door, small bits of light poke through the shade to indicate he is still here. She bends down but unable to peer through the tiny slits of light, tilting her head to the side she puts her ear to the wooden door, but she hears her own heavy heartbeat, moving her head away from the door she stands back up straight as she fixes her ponytail and smooths out the wrinkles in her black dress that ends about halfway between her hips and knee. Her heart racing faster as she grips the papers in one hand and the door handle with the other. You got this. She thinks to herself, palms sweaty as she turns the handle, opening the door slowly. Brynn is sitting at his desk with his head down into some paperwork before he leaves for the day. He is wearing bluejeans along with the companies red shirt with its logo on it. His brown leather jacket hangs on the hook along the wall behind him, his computer monitor turned off with a silly sign over it that says, The files are in the computer? in reference to the movie Zoolander, along with the image of the scene to match. She steps inside his office closing the door behind her carefully, his attention elsewhere as he doesnt hear or see her come in and is startled when she slams the pile of papers on his desk over his own. Anya sees the sign over the monitor as she scoffs at such a childish movie, Seems about right for him. she mutters to herself as Brynn looks up to see Anya standing over him with her arms crossed. Brynns face with some confusion as she slams the papers in her hand onto the desk in front of him, taken back slightly he looks down at them and then back to her.

Assistant
Thanks, Travis. Here's a full breakdown per your request  including inline comments, summary feedback, a rewrite suggestion **that preserves your voice**, and a save-file-compatible format for use later. Lets go section by section:

---

###  INLINE COMMENTS ( = suggestion,  = working well)

> The office was quiet as it was nearing the end of the day, the clock on the wall as Anya walks past it showing 5:05pm.  
 *Tense conflict ("was" and "walks"). Consider keeping past tense throughout for smoother flow.*  

> She is already staying later than normal which makes her more upset for this whole situation.  
 *"More upset for this whole situation" is a little vague. You might clarify the emotional stakes or what this refers to.*

> Nervously, she shifts from foot to foot as her heels, heavy with clicking on the tile floor, approaches Brynns office.  
 *Subject-verb agreement: "heels...approaches" should be "heels...approach." Also "heavy with clicking" could be cleanermaybe "click loudly on the tile floor."*  

> His door plain looking door is closed...  
 *Typo: "door plain looking door"  likely meant His plain-looking door is closed*  

> ...puts her ear to the wooden door, but she hears her own heavy heartbeat...  
 *Nice sensory detail"her own heavy heartbeat" is vivid and adds tension.*  

> ...smooths out the wrinkles in her black dress that ends about halfway between her hips and knee.  
 *Suggest clarifying "between her hips and knee"maybe "mid-thigh" or just "above the knee."*  

> You got this. She thinks to herself...  
 *Internal dialogue formatting: should be *You got this,* she thinks to herself.*  

> ...his attention elsewhere as he doesnt hear or see her come in...  
 *Could be more active: "He's so focused he doesn't notice her enter."*

> ...with a silly sign over it that says, The files are in the computer? in reference to the movie Zoolander...  
 *This line adds personality and contrast between characters. Good cultural touch.*  

> ...her arms crossed. Brynns face with some confusion as she slams...  
 *Incomplete structure: "Brynns face with some confusion" needs a verb (e.g., shows some confusion).*

---

###  SUMMARY NOTES

- **Tone:** You're nailing a slightly awkward, emotionally tense atmosphereAnyas nervousness comes through strongly.
- **Voice:** Internal monologue and sensory detail are solid and distinct.
- **Biggest issue:** Consistency in **verb tense**, **sentence structure**, and a few **wording choices**. Some sentences run too long or combine ideas that might benefit from a breath or shift.
- **Characterization:** The contrast between Anya's composed appearance and her inner tension works well. Brynns personality starts to peek through with the movie reference.

---

###  REWRITE SUGGESTION (Preserving Voice)

Heres a lightly cleaned-up version with your voice intact:

---

**Rewritten Paragraph:**  
The office was quietit was nearly the end of the day. The clock on the wall read 5:05 p.m. as Anya walked past it. She was already staying later than usual, which only made her more irritated about the whole situation.  

Nervously, she shifted from foot to foot, her heels clicking sharply on the tile floor as she approached Brynns office. His plain-looking door was shut, his nameplate just above a sign that claimed he was out of the office. The shade behind the glass blocked the view inside, but thin slivers of light poked throughhe was still there.  

Anya bent down, trying to peer through the tiny cracks, then tilted her head and pressed her ear to the wooden door. All she could hear was her own heavy heartbeat. Straightening, she fixed her ponytail, smoothed the wrinkles in her black dressjust above the kneeand took a deep breath. She clutched the papers in one hand, her other hand tightening around the door handle.  

*You got this,* she told herself, palms sweaty as she slowly turned the handle.  

Brynn sat at his desk, head buried in paperwork. He wore jeans and the company's red logo shirt. His leather jacket hung on a hook behind him, and his monitor was off, a silly sign taped over it: *The files are in the computer?*a clear nod to *Zoolander*, complete with a screenshot.  

She stepped inside quietly, shutting the door behind her. He didnt hear her come in. Without a word, she slammed the papers onto his desk, startling him. His head snapped up, confusion flashing across his face. She crossed her arms, scoffing at the movie reference.  

Figures, she muttered.

What about this? This better?

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didnt hold with such nonsense.

Mr. Dursley was the director of a rm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no ner boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursleys sister, but they hadnt met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didnt have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didnt want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl utter past the window.

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. Little tyke, chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number fours drive.

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the rst sign of something peculiar  a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didnt realize what he had seen  then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasnt a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive  no, looking at the sign; cats couldnt read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.

Assistant
This is a fantastic comparison piecethank you for dropping it in. Youre referencing the iconic opening of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone* by J.K. Rowling, which is a masterclass in tone-setting, subtle world-building, and character introduction. Lets break this down through the lens of your project and compare it directly to your paragraph with the goal of improving your scene **without compromising your voice**.

---

###  What This Passage Does Well (and Why It Works)

####  **Establishes Tone with Authority**
> *Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.*  
This first sentence has a confident, almost whimsical narrative voice. It tells you immediately: this book has a narrator with personality. It balances humor and mysterytwo things your story could benefit from dialing up just a notch.

####  **Characterization Through Specificity**
> *...a big, beefy man with hardly any neck...*  
Characters are not just described; theyre described with personality and judgment. That judgment is what makes the voice feel alive. You start doing this with Anyas reaction to the Zoolander signkeep going!

####  **Seeds of Conflict Are Embedded Early**
> *The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret...*  
This is classic foreshadowing: it's telling you *something weird is coming* without showing it directlyyet.

####  **Pacing and Sentence Structure**
This passage balances long descriptive sentences with short, impactful moments. For example:
> *None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.*  
Its just one line. That makes it eerie. That punchy delivery is worth emulatingyour version often stays in long, multi-action sentences that could be broken up for rhythm and tension.

####  **Grounds the Extraordinary in the Ordinary**
> *It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar  a cat reading a map.*  
The use of peculiar softens the blow. Its playful. You're allowed to show weirdness earlyas long as it's done with a wink, not a sledgehammer.

---

###  How You Can Apply This to Your Own Paragraph

Your paragraph is already full of **emotion**, **internal conflict**, and **tension**, especially around Anya. What you might borrow from Rowlings approach:

| Rowlings Strength | Suggested Adaptation in Your Voice |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| Narrator with a knowing voice | Try letting the narrator express subtle judgment (e.g., *"Of course he'd have a Zoolander quote on his monitor. Typical."*) |
| Clear tone from sentence one | Consider an opening that sets mood instantly. Right now, it starts mechanically (The office was quiet...). Try something punchier, like: *Anya hated working late. Especially when it involved Brynn.* |
| Specific, vivid description | You already do thisjust tighten it. Instead of *"heels, heavy with clicking,"* maybe *"heels clicking like a metronome of dread."* |
| Use short sentences for emphasis | Break up longer passages. For example: *She hears nothing but her heartbeat. She hates that.* gives punch and internality. |
| Hint at deeper stakes early | Right now, the situation is ambiguous. What does Anya fear? Whats in the papers? A single ominous line can anchor the reader. |

---

###  Sample Revision Applying This Style (Keeping *Your* Voice)

Heres your paragraph, reimagined using Rowling-esque elements while preserving your erotic-romance tone and Anyas personality:

---

**New Version:**  
Anya hated staying late. Especially when it had to do with Brynn.  

The office was nearly empty. Quiet. The wall clock read 5:05 p.m.she shouldve been gone ten minutes ago. Her heels clicked across the tile, each step louder than it should be.  

Brynns door was closed. A dull nameplate. A sign reading *Out of Office*. The shade drawn. But thin lines of light peeked through. He was still in there.  

She bent down to look through the slatsnothing. Tilted her head, pressed her ear to the wood. Just her heartbeat. Loud and useless.  

She straightened, fixed her ponytail, smoothed her black dress just above the knee. One hand gripped the papers. The other, the door handle.  

*You got this,* she told herself. Her palm was sweating.  

The door creaked open.  

Brynn sat at his desk, eyes buried in paperwork. Jeans. Company logo shirt. Leather jacket on the hook behind him. His monitor was offexcept for a ridiculous sign taped to it: *The files are in the computer?* A still from *Zoolander.*  

She scoffed. Of course.  

She closed the door behind her. Quiet. He didnt even look up.  

*SLAM.*  
The papers hit his desk.  

His head snapped up. Confused.  

She stood over him, arms crossed. *Figures,* she muttered.

---

Let me know if you want that folded into a formal savepoint or if you'd like help applying this rhythm across the whole chapter. You're on the right trackthis is *voice-forward writing* with real emotional stakes, it just needs a little polish and intentional pacing.
