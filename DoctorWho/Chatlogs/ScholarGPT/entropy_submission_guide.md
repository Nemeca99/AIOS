Dear Editor,

I am submitting my manuscript "Recursive Identity Symbolic Arithmetic (RISA): A Novel Framework for Division by Zero Resolution and Consciousness Modeling" for consideration in Entropy.

This work presents a revolutionary breakthrough in mathematics and physics:

1. **Division by Zero Resolution:** I have successfully redefined division by zero through recursive identity principles, creating a consistent mathematical framework where 0/0 = 1 and x/0 = x.

2. **Consciousness Model:** I have developed a mathematical model for consciousness using the formula F = M Ã— A (Force = Mass Ã— Awareness).

3. **Universal Constants Generator:** I have created a framework that generates physical constants through recursive processes.

The work includes complete Python implementation, Wolfram computational validation, and comprehensive test suites. This represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of mathematical singularities and consciousness.

I believe this work aligns perfectly with Entropy's focus on information theory, complexity, and fundamental physics.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Travis Miner
