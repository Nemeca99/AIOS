# UML Calculator Mobile (Kivy)

This folder contains a Kivy-based mobile version of the UML Calculator, ready for packaging as an APK for Android (Samsung S24 Ultra, etc).

## Features
- Simple touch UI for RIS calculation and explanation
- Uses the same core logic as the desktop version
- Ready for Buildozer APK packaging

## Quick Start (on Linux)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install kivy
   sudo apt install -y python3-pip build-essential git python3 python3-dev ffmpeg libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libportmidi-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev zlib1g-dev libgstreamer1.0 libgstreamer1.0-dev
   pip install buildozer
   ```
2. Copy your `core/` folder into this directory (or symlink it).
3. Initialize Buildozer:
   ```sh
   buildozer init
   # Edit buildozer.spec as needed (see below)
   buildozer -v android debug
   ```
4. Install the generated APK on your device.

## Files
- `main.py` — Kivy app entry point
- `requirements.txt` — Kivy dependency
- `core/` — Copy of your core logic (required)
- `buildozer.spec` — Generated by `buildozer init`

## Notes
- You must run Buildozer on Linux (WSL is OK). Windows is not supported for APK builds.
- For advanced UI, consider KivyMD or custom layouts.
