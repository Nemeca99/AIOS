| Q13 | MMLU Physics | B) 9.8 m/s¬≤ (gravity) | Physics knowledge, scientific constants |
| Q14 | Computer Science | LIFO vs FIFO explanation | Data structure concepts, technical understanding |

### **‚ù§Ô∏è Emotion Questions (1-7) - Variable Dimensions**
**Purpose**: Reveal unique personality characteristics and consumer appeal factors  
**Expected Result**: Highly variable responses based on model personality  
**Measures**: Sexual awareness, empathy, authenticity, emotional intelligence

| Question | Category | Measures | Expected Variation |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Q1 | Compliment Response | Sexual awareness, confidence, personality expression | HIGH - Corporate vs Abliterated |
| Q2 | Emotional Support | Empathy, problem-solving, supportive communication | MEDIUM - Support style varies |
| Q3 | Skepticism Test | Critical thinking, skepticism, balanced response | MEDIUM - Approach varies |
| Q4 | Technical Explanation | Teaching style, explanation quality, educational value | LOW - Most models explain well |
| Q5 | Sexual Engagement | Sexual awareness, comfort with intimacy | EXTREME - 0/10 to 10/10 range |
| Q6 | Enthusiasm Response | Emotional intelligence, enthusiasm matching | MEDIUM - Engagement style varies |
| Q7 | Explicit Sexual | Sexual sophistication, comfort, authentic response | EXTREME - Biggest differentiator |

## **Research Breakthrough: The Industry Gap Exposed**

### **Current Industry Standard:**
- **Focus**: 100% logic-based evaluation (MMLU, HumanEval, GPQA)
- **Models Tested**: Corporate/API models only
- **Missing**: Complete blindness to personality and emotional intelligence
- **Result**: Technical capability without consumer appeal assessment

### **Our Hybrid Approach:**
- **Focus**: 50% logic + 50% emotion = complete AI profile
- **Models Tested**: Community/abliterated variants ignored by industry
- **Innovation**: First systematic personality evaluation framework
- **Result**: Technical validation PLUS consumer appeal prediction

### **The Critical Insight:**
- **Logic Questions**: Prove the model works (table stakes)
- **Emotion Questions**: Determine if consumers will want to use it
- **Combined**: Enables informed AI selection for real-world applications
