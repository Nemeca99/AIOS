Google Doc Access Issue

User
Instructions for the AI:

Hello! I have a link to a Google Doc that Id like you to use. Please read and follow the instructions outlined in the document to assist the user with their request.

Google Doc Link:
https:docs.google.comdocumentd1G9e1Prww5kBo7SvoBIAfCIScN94R63vvvAYbqsxbMr4edit?usp=sharing

The document contains step-by-step instructions for guiding a user through an AI onboarding process. The user will respond to prompts based on the document, and I need you to process those responses in a clear, helpful, and structured way.

Once the document is read, you should begin asking the user the necessary questions or steps as described. Handle the responses according to the directions and produce a clean, actionable outcome.

Let me know when youre ready to start!

I currently don't have access to external links, so I can't read the Google Doc directly. However, if you'd like, you can paste the content of the document or the key instructions here, and I can follow them accordingly. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
