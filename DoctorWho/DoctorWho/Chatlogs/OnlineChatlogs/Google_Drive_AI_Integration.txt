Google Drive AI Integration

Tool
All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded. Searching won't provide additional information.

Assistant
I see the script you've uploaded (`startup_no_delete.py`). It integrates with Google Drive, authenticates, and synchronizes memory between specified files. Additionally, it loads and executes the child AI code. The `DELETE_TEMP_FILE` flag is used to control temporary file deletion after the process.

Would you like me to assist with any modifications, troubleshoot any issues, or help with integrating this further?
