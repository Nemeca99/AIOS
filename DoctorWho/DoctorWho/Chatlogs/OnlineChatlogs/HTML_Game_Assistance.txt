I am trying to create an idleincremental game like Evolve or Kittens game

Great! Idleincremental games can be a lot of fun to create, and HTML is a great platform for building these types of games. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you can follow to create an idleincremental game:

1. Plan out your game mechanics: Before you start coding, it's important to have a clear idea of the game mechanics you want to include. Idle games are all about progression and growth, so think about the different ways players can accumulate resources, upgrade their abilities, and unlock new features. Some common game mechanics you might want to include are clickables, upgrades, achievements, and prestige systems.

2. Design your game layout: Once you have a plan for your game mechanics, you can start thinking about the overall layout of your game. Consider how you want to display information to the player, such as resource counts, upgrades, and other important stats. You may also want to create a menu or sidebar to house different game features.

3. Code the game logic: With your game mechanics and layout in mind, it's time to start coding the game logic. This will involve writing JavaScript functions to handle things like resource generation, upgrade purchases, and other player actions. You'll also need to use HTML and CSS to create the game interface.

4. Test and debug your game: As you build your game, make sure to test it frequently to ensure that everything is working as intended. Use your browser's developer tools to check for errors and fix any bugs that arise.

5. Add polish: Once your game is functioning properly, you can focus on adding additional features and polishing the game experience. This might include things like sound effects, animations, or additional game modes.

6. Publish your game: Finally, when your game is complete, you can publish it online for others to enjoy. You can host your game on a personal website or use a platform like itch.io to share it with a wider audience.

Of course, this is just a general overview of the steps involved in creating an idleincremental game in HTML. Depending on the complexity of your game, you may encounter additional challenges along the way. But with a little bit of perseverance and a willingness to learn, you should be able to create an engaging and enjoyable game that players will love.

How do I start?

Assistant
Great question! Here are some steps to help you get started on your HTML idleincremental game:

1. Set up your development environment: Before you can start coding your game, you'll need to set up a development environment. This involves choosing a code editor (such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text), creating a new HTML file, and linking to any necessary libraries or frameworks (such as jQuery or Bootstrap).

2. Create the basic HTML structure: Once your development environment is set up, you can start creating the basic HTML structure for your game. This will involve creating containers for your game elements, such as a main game container, a sidebar for game information, and separate containers for different game features.

3. Add CSS styling: Once you have the basic HTML structure in place, you can start adding CSS styling to make your game look more polished. This will involve writing CSS rules to style your containers, add background images or colors, and adjust the layout and position of different game elements.

4. Start coding the game logic: With your HTML and CSS in place, you can start coding the game logic using JavaScript. This will involve writing functions to handle things like resource generation, upgrades, and other player actions. You may also want to incorporate a library like jQuery to make it easier to manipulate the DOM.

5. Test and debug: As you build your game, make sure to test it frequently to ensure that everything is working as intended. Use your browser's developer tools to check for errors and fix any bugs that arise.

6. Add additional features and polish: Once your basic game mechanics are in place and the game is functioning properly, you can start adding additional features and polish. This might include things like sound effects, animations, or additional game modes.

Remember, creating an HTML game can be a challenging and time-consuming process, but it can also be a lot of fun! Take your time, break the process down into manageable steps, and don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. Good luck!
