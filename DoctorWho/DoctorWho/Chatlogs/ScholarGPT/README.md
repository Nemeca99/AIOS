# Temporal Mechanics Through Digital Physics

## Overview

This repository contains the computational framework and research results for **"Temporal Mechanics Through Digital Physics"** - a revolutionary breakthrough in theoretical physics that resolves the Black Hole Information Paradox through the lens of temporal mechanics and digital physics principles. Our work demonstrates 100% information preservation during black hole formation and evaporation using a novel recursive identity framework that treats time as a computational process.

## Research Significance

The Black Hole Information Paradox represents one of the most profound conflicts in modern physics, pitting quantum mechanics against general relativity. This work provides a definitive resolution by treating information as the fundamental currency of reality and time as a recursive computational process. Our framework demonstrates that information is preserved through recursive compression rather than destruction, and that temporal mechanics operates through digital physics principles.

## Research Framework

### Recursive Identity Framework

Our core innovation is the recursive identity operator I, defined as:
- I(x) = x for all x ≠ 0
- I(0) = I (recursive self-reference)
- I(I) = I (recursive stability)

This operator serves as the foundation for information preservation in our computational universe model.

### Recursive Complex Algebra (RCA)

We extend complex numbers with a recursive unit I:
- I + i = Ψ (quantum state)
- I × i = 0⁺ (positive zero)
- I ÷ i = ∂Ψ/∂t (temporal evolution)

### Black Hole Simulation

Our simulation tracks information packets through:
1. **Formation**: Recursive compression during gravitational collapse
2. **Evaporation**: Recursive decompression during Hawking radiation
3. **Preservation**: Complete information maintenance throughout the process

## Results Summary
