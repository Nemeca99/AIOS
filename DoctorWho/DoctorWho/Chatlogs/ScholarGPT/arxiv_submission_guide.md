## üìù Submission Details

### Title
```
Recursive Complex Algebra: A Novel Mathematical Framework for Information Preservation in Black Hole Physics
```

### Abstract
```
We present Recursive Complex Algebra (RCA), a novel mathematical framework that extends complex numbers with a recursive unit I = 0/0. This framework provides a mathematical foundation for information preservation in black hole physics and resolves the Black Hole Information Paradox through recursive identity operations. RCA introduces a three-dimensional identity space {1, i, I} where I represents recursive compression rather than information destruction. Our computational simulations demonstrate 100% information preservation in black hole formation and evaporation processes, providing a concrete solution to one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical physics.
