# UML Calculator (Community Edition)

A modern calculator that combines standard mathematics with UML diagram generation capabilities, designed for both practical calculations and visualizing mathematical concepts.

## Features

**This Community Edition includes:**

- Standard mathematical operations and equation solving
- Basic UML diagram generation for mathematical concepts
- Terminal-based user interface with rich formatting
- Function plotting with terminal visualization
- Limited set of Recursive Integration System (RIS) operations

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uml-calculator.git
cd uml-calculator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start the calculator
python ui/modern_cli.py

# Direct command examples
python ui/modern_cli.py calc "2 + 3*5"
python ui/modern_cli.py plot "x^2 + 2*x - 3"
python ui/modern_cli.py uml rules
```

## Example Outputs

### Standard Calculations

```
>>> calc "3*x^2 - 5*x + 2"
Expression: 3*x^2 - 5*x + 2
Result: 24.0
```

### UML Diagrams

The calculator can generate UML diagrams to visualize mathematical operations:
