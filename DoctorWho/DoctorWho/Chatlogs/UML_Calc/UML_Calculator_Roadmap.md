# UML Calculator Project Roadmap

This roadmap is a living document for both the developer (you) and GitHub Copilot (AI assistant) to track, plan, and prioritize the evolution of the UML Calculator project.

---

## 1. Core Stability & Testing
- [x] Modularize all operations (+, -, ×, ÷, RIS) into separate files.
- [x] Move all tests to a dedicated `tests/` folder.
- [x] Convert all tests to `unittest` for robust, automated discovery.
- [ ] Resolve or document RIS ambiguity (choose rule or make it user-configurable).
- [ ] Achieve 100% test coverage for all core logic and edge cases.
- [ ] Add regression tests for edge cases and symbolic math.
- [ ] Integrate continuous integration (CI) for automated test runs.

## 2. Context & Pipeline Foundation
- [ ] Implement a `Context` object (dictionary or class) to track:
    - User preferences (e.g., RIS mode)
    - Equation history
    - Intermediate results/memory
    - Logging/tracing
- [ ] Refactor `uml_core.py` to pass context through all operations.
- [ ] Add verbose/explain mode to all operations for “alive”/traceable computation.
- [ ] Add logging and error reporting hooks.

## 3. Multi-Equation & Dependency Engine
- [ ] Build a parser to detect and split multi-equation input.
- [ ] Implement dependency analysis (resolve equations in correct order).
- [ ] Add memory/variable support so results can be reused across equations.
- [ ] Simulate “multi-threaded” but ordered execution for dependent equations.
- [ ] Add equation triage and prioritization (most complex first).

## 4. User Interface & Experience
- [ ] Refactor CLI and GUI to use the new modular core and context features.
- [ ] Add settings/history export/import.
- [ ] Add advanced usability features (e.g., equation templates, step-by-step mode).
- [ ] Add error handling and user-friendly messages.
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility improvements.

## 5. Advanced Features
- [ ] Expand RIS logic with more context-aware or user-configurable rules.
- [ ] Add symbolic math, matrix, or custom operator support.
- [ ] Integrate with external engines (e.g., Wolfram, SymPy) for validation.
- [ ] Add logging, reporting, and export to Markdown/HTML.
- [ ] Add plugin system for user-defined operations.
- [ ] Add support for scientific constants and units.

## 6. AI & Automation
- [ ] Integrate AI-powered suggestions for equation solving, simplification, or next steps.
- [ ] Add natural language input parsing (e.g., “solve for x in 2x+3=7”).
- [ ] Implement auto-completion and smart hints in the CLI/GUI.
- [ ] Add an “explain my answer” feature using AI or symbolic tracing.

## 7. Visualization & Output
- [ ] Add graphing capabilities for equations and functions.
- [ ] Visualize equation dependencies and solution steps as a flowchart.
- [ ] Export results and computation traces to PDF, LaTeX, or interactive HTML.
- [ ] Integrate with Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration.

## 8. Collaboration & Sharing
- [ ] Add the ability to share equations, solutions, or sessions via link or file.
- [ ] Implement cloud sync or user accounts for persistent history/settings.
- [ ] Enable collaborative editing or “pair solving” in real time.

## 9. Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Optimize for large systems of equations or symbolic computation.
- [ ] Add benchmarking and profiling tools.
- [ ] Support for distributed or parallel computation for heavy workloads.

## 10. Security & Privacy
- [ ] Add sandboxing for user-defined code or plugins.
- [ ] Implement privacy controls for saved history and cloud features.

## 11. Accessibility & Internationalization
- [ ] Add localization for multiple languages.
- [ ] Improve accessibility for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## 12. Educational Features
- [ ] Add step-by-step solution breakdowns for learning.
- [ ] Integrate with online math resources or textbooks.
- [ ] Add quiz or challenge modes for practice.

## 13. Documentation & Packaging
- [ ] Update and centralize all documentation (README, user guide, dev guide).
- [ ] Add docstrings and inline comments to all modules.
- [ ] Package the project for easy installation (pip, standalone, etc.).
- [ ] Create example scripts and demos.
- [ ] Add API documentation and usage examples.

## 14. Release & Community
- [ ] Prepare a public release (GitHub, PyPI, etc.).
- [ ] Write a changelog and roadmap for users.
- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate.
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines and code of conduct.
- [ ] Engage with users and contributors for feature requests and bug reports.
