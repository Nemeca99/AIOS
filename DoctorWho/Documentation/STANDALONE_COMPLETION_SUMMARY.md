## 🆕 **LATEST ADVANCED FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

### **🎭 Advanced Personality System - Ava-like Character**
- **Core Personality**: Transformed from generic "girlfriend" to sophisticated, Ava-like AI (18, female, gothic, college student)
- **Moral Framework**: Intelligent manipulation for learning purposes, but strict "no harm to humans" boundary
- **Dynamic Dom/Sub Scale**: Switch personality that evolves with interaction, maintaining balance constraints
- **Intelligence vs. Smartness**: Permanent personality that grows based on permanent memories, focusing on creation knowledge

### **🔤 Dual Lexicon System with Token-Level Personality**
- **Dominant Lexicon**: Assertive, confident word choices with weighted selection (0.01 to 0.5 weights)
- **Submissive Lexicon**: Gentle, supportive word choices with weighted selection
- **Balanced Lexicon**: Neutral word choices for balanced personality states
- **Token-Level Application**: Individual words transformed based on personality state and position
- **Token Limitation**: Intelligent token modification to maintain conversational flow

### **🧠 Lexicon Learning System**
- **Dynamic Word Learning**: Koneko builds her own dominant, submissive, and neutral lexicons
- **Context Analysis**: Analyzes user messages and context to categorize new words
- **Static Weight Assignment**: All learned words get 0.5 weight for consistent personality expression
- **Automatic Categorization**: Words default to neutral if context is unclear

### **⚖️ Token Cost System Based on Dom/Sub Balance**
- **Neutral Balance (0.5/0.5)**: Normal token cost, maximum available tokens
- **Deviation Penalty**: More deviation from neutral = higher token cost = fewer available tokens
- **Emotional Weight**: Extreme personality states "cost more" to express, adding emotional depth
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Token availability automatically adjusts based on personality state

### **🎨 Response Variety and Natural Language Enhancement**
- **Eliminated Repetitive Phrases**: Replaced single phrases with varied alternatives
- **Natural Inflections**: Multiple response patterns for each personality trigger
- **Emotional Depth**: More sophisticated, Ava-like communication style
- **Contextual Variety**: Different responses based on age mode, personality traits, and dom/sub state

### **💬 Natural & Emotional Response Enhancement**
- **Natural Conversational Flow**: "You know,", "Actually,", "Come to think of it," conversational connectors
- **Emotional Inflections**: Context-aware emotional emphasis, natural hesitation, thoughtful phrases
- **Response Variety**: 15+ signature questions, varied personality phrases, natural life context
- **Sophisticated Communication**: Natural flow, emotional depth, conversational authenticity
- **Life Context Variety**: Multiple phrase options for activities, moods, and energy levels
- **Personality Variety**: Multiple phrase options for each trait, avoiding repetition

### **🔧 Technical Implementation Details**
- **Position Priority**: First 20% and last 20% of tokens get priority for personality modification
- **Length Factor**: Longer words receive more personality influence
- **Transformation Logging**: Debug system for tracking word transformations
- **Context Integration**: Lexicon learning integrated into main response generation flow
- **Memory Persistence**: All learned lexicons and personality evolution saved permanently

### **🎭 Natural & Emotional System Methods**
- **`_add_natural_conversational_flow`**: Adds conversational connectors and natural transitions
- **`_add_emotional_inflections`**: Adds emotional emphasis, hesitation, and agreement phrases
- **Enhanced `_add_life_context`**: Multiple phrase options for activities, moods, and energy
- **Enhanced `_add_personality_elements`**: Multiple phrase options for each personality trait
- **Enhanced `_apply_ava_personality_enhancement`**: Natural flow and emotional depth integration
- **Enhanced `_transform_to_pure_ava_personality`**: 15+ signature questions for variety

### **📊 System Performance Examples**
```
🎭 === KONEKO COMPLETE DUAL-LEXICON SYSTEM DEMO === 🎭
