## DEBUGGING THE COMPARISON ERROR

### Error Location
The error occurs in `fractal_mycelium_cache.py` in the `find_relevant_fragments` method during:
- Emotion similarity scoring
- Tone similarity scoring
- Specialization determination

### Previous Fixes Attempted
1. ✅ Fixed emotion similarity scoring with numeric checks
2. ✅ Fixed tone similarity scoring with numeric checks
3. ✅ Fixed specialization determination with numeric checks
4. ✅ Added error handling in Luna integration

### Remaining Issue
The error still occurs intermittently, suggesting there may be:
- Non-numeric values in emotion_scores or tone_signature
- Dictionary values being compared directly
- Missing type checking in some code paths

### Debugging Approach
1. Add more detailed logging to identify exact comparison
2. Check all dictionary values for type consistency
3. Add comprehensive type checking throughout
4. Test with different question types to isolate the issue

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Fix the comparison error** in CARMA system
2. **Run comprehensive tests** to verify fix
3. **Prepare for overnight testing** with 100+ questions

### Overnight Testing
1. **Run continuous test** with 100+ questions
2. **Monitor system stability** and performance
3. **Collect data** on CARMA vs Luna performance
4. **Document results** for research paper

### Long-term
1. **Optimize CARMA system** for better reliability
2. **Expand testing** with different question types
3. **Prepare research paper** for publication
4. **Develop production version** for deployment
