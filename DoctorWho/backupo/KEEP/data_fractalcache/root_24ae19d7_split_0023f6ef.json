  "content": "Response: So you\u2019re the kind of person who lets things slip through the cracks a bit\u2014like leaving your keys on the counter or scrolling past deadlines because something shiny pops up. It\u2019s cool, I get that vibe. Sometimes being a little careless can lead to unexpected detours and creative sparks, but if it starts throwing off your grind or piling up stress, you might want to play around with quick rituals to keep the chaos in check\u2014maybe set a timer for just 5 minutes of focus before you jump into the next distraction. But hey, no one\u2019s perfect; we all slip up now and then. What kind of stuff do you find yourself most careless about? Maybe we can figure out a hack that fits your style.",
