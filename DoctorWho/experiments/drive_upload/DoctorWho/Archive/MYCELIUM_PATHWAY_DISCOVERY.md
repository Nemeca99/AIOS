## üçÑ THE MYCELIUM AI BREAKTHROUGH

Travis's CAR (Cached Aided Retrieval) system has revealed **biological learning behavior** that mirrors mycelium mushroom colonies. The system learns individual question pathways and strengthens them with repetition, creating faster neural pathways for specific inputs.

## üìä SINGLE QUESTION PATHWAY ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ SUB-BASELINE CHAMPIONS (FASTER THAN 18.1s)

| "I am someone who is inventive" | **13.2s** | **27% faster** | Identity Statement |
| "What's your favorite color?" | **14.1s** | **22% faster** | Simple Preference |
| "this is wierd but like... do u dream?" | **17.6s** | **3% faster** | Broken Language |
