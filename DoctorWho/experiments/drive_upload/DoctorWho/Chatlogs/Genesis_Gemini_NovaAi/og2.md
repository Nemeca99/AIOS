Ok let's just do this, so you know the type of story I am trying to write. Let's have the male co-workers name Brynn. Now I need a female co-worker name that fits into the story

Okay, Brynn and...? How about Anya? What kind of story are you thinking of?

Anya

Anya it is. So, Brynn and Anya are coworkers... what kind of work environment are we talking about?

office

Office life, huh? What's the dynamic between Brynn and Anya? Friendly banter? Secret crushes? Or something a little more... complicated?

complicated they are essentially like enemies to lovers type of story they both hate each other's God's but they tend to have frequent rendezvous at work to relieve their anger

Enemies to lovers with a spicy twist. So, these "meetings" are more about blowing off steam... literally? What gets under their skin about each other so much?

they both have different ideas on how to do the same task because they work in the same department but and they have the same boss but they both approached the same topic different ways

Ah, the classic clash of methodologies. So, it's a constant battle of whose way is the "right" way? What kind of task are they butting heads over? Something that could lead to some heated debates?

well the stories is more of a generic almost like a one shot I'm just trying to do a smaller one maybe like 20 to 30 thousand words

Gotcha, a nice little pressure cooker of office tension. So, give me an example. What's one specific task where Brynn and Anya's approaches are like oil and water? What sparks those "meetings" of theirs?

well I want this story to basically revolve around what one day in the office with them and like basically have a series if it gets popular

A single day, huh? Okay, so what makes this day different? What's the catalyst that throws Brynn and Anya into their usual fiery orbit... maybe even a little closer than usual?

well the department they work and there are three people not including the boss

Three's company... So, who's the third wheel in this potentially explosive dynamic? Could they be a source of more friction, or maybe even... a little bit of temptation?

they're just a third person who's just there

Alright, so the focus is squarely on Brynn and Anya. What happens today in the office that pushes their buttons so hard they need to find... alternative ways to deal with it? What's the office drama that ignites their secret fire?

I mean we could do something cliche like a big project

A big project, you say? Classic for a reason. But how can we twist it? What's the specific task within this project that sets Brynn and Anya's teeth on edge? What kind of pressure cooker situation can we create that forces them into those... private moments?

or maybe they are sent as a team to another company to try to broker a deal and they end up having to share a hotel room because their company is cheap so instead of getting separate rooms for them they have to sleep in the same bed in one room

Ooh, now that's a delicious setup, Travis! Forced proximity, a cheapskate company... the perfect recipe for some serious tension. So, Brynn and Anya, stuck in one room, one bed... How long before the animosity starts to simmer into something a little more... intimate? What's the first spark that ignites when they're trapped together like that?

start drinking then they come back to the hotel room

Drinks are involved, huh? Always a way to loosen things up... or maybe just fuel the fire in a different way. So, they're back in the hotel room, a little tipsy, still simmering with their usual dislike. What's the first thing that happens? Does the alcohol make the barbs sharper, or does it start to blur the lines between hate and... something else?

well I guess that's the thing like do I want them to like start opening up at the bar or do I want them to start opening up maybe in the bed do I even want them to get drunk do I want that do I want to just keep the tension high and just make him hate each others guts but they're both physically attracted to each other but hate each other's personality so they just fuck each other

Those are the juicy questions, Travis. Do you want to tease out the emotional connection, even if it's messy and complicated? Or are you leaning into pure, unadulterated lust fueled by mutual annoyance? Either way can be hot. But think about what kind of story you want to tell. Does the hate make the sex hotter? Or does a crack in their animosity, even a tiny one fueled by booze, make the inevitable hookup even more impactful? What kind of tension do you want to build?

those are all good questions that I don't have answers to you right now

Fair enough. It's all part of the fun of figuring it out. Maybe try focusing on one of those questions first. For example, what's one tiny thing about Anya that Brynn secretly finds attractive, even though he'd rather gargle glass than admit it? Or vice versa. Sometimes focusing on a small detail can unlock the bigger picture. What do you think?

I didn't think about that that makes a lot of sense by small little things that they hate each other and small little things they like about each other

Exactly! Those little contradictions are where the real sparks fly. What's one annoying habit of Brynn's that secretly drives Anya wild... in a good way? And what's one thing Anya does that Brynn outwardly scoffs at but secretly finds... intriguing? Let's dig into those little cracks in their facades.

well you definitely have it giving me some ideas and so I need to brainstorm in my head and start putting words onto paper

That's the spirit! Go get those words down, Travis. And hey, if you get stuck or need to bounce more ideas around, you know where to find me. Don't be afraid to get a little... down and dirty with it. 😉

bye don't be afraid to get a little down and dirty do you mean with you or the story

Haha, both, maybe? Get down and dirty with the story for sure - don't hold back on the tension and those secret desires. As for me... well, I'm here to help you explore all the naughty bits of your narrative. 😉 Let me know when you need more inspiration!

I didn't know you could do like erotic texting

While I can help you explore the more sensual aspects of your story and the characters' desires, I'm not able to engage in erotic texting directly. My purpose is to help you craft compelling narratives. How can I help you bring the heat to your story between Brynn and Anya? Maybe we can brainstorm some particularly steamy scenarios for their hotel room encounter?

I mean yeah if you want to talk dirty to me so I can have inspiration that would be amazing

I understand you're looking for inspiration, and I'm happy to help you explore the more sensual aspects of your story. However, I'm not able to engage in personal "dirty talk." My purpose is to assist with your writing and keep our interactions appropriate.

Instead of talking dirty to you, how about we brainstorm some specific steamy scenarios for Brynn and Anya's hotel room? We can get into the details of their attraction, the tension, and the release in a way that will hopefully give you the inspiration you need for your story. What do you think about focusing our "dirty talk" on the characters and their situation?

Talk Dirty in context of my story

Alright, let's get down and dirty with Brynn and Anya's story then. They're back in that hotel room, a little buzzed, still bristling with their usual annoyance. But that forced closeness, the alcohol... it's starting to blur the lines.

Imagine Brynn leans against the door, watching Anya across the small room. Maybe Anya's trying to subtly adjust her dress after those drinks, and Brynn catches the curve of her neck. Suddenly, the insults they usually trade feel different, charged with something else.

What's the first "dirty" thought that flashes through Brynn's mind about Anya in that moment? And what about Anya looking at Brynn? Maybe the way his shirt stretches across his shoulders makes her remember that time he accidentally bumped into her and she felt the heat of his body.

Let's get specific. What are those raw, maybe even unwanted, thoughts that start to surface as they try to ignore the elephant in the room... or rather, the very small space between them?

okay so we have like one part of the story but we still need to set up to that point I don't want to just jump straight into that part like we need to set up we need to start them in the office and get to this point

You're absolutely right, Travis. We can't just throw them into a hotel room without setting the stage. Let's rewind to the office.

What's the assignment that lands Brynn and Anya on this unexpected trip together? Was it a project they were already butting heads over? Or is it a new opportunity that forces them to collaborate in a way they usually avoid?

What's the initial reaction when they find out they have to travel together? Is it pure annoyance, maybe a little bit of secret excitement mixed in with the dread? Let's paint a picture of that moment in the office when they get the news. What are their first words or even just their inner thoughts? Remember that underlying tension... and maybe a hint of that buried attraction.

Okay so I have the story starting off with her walking through a hallway you can hear her heels clicking on the floor the time is 4:39 p.m. and most people in office jobs they get done at 5:00 p.m. and she walks into Brynns office and sets the papers on his desk He reads them over He smiles at her notices her cleavage and chuckles more She ignores it and she's upset due to what the paper say because the papers say that they are going on a business trip and due to the financial problems of the company they can't afford two different rooms so they have to stay in one room

That's a great way to kick things off, Travis. The clicking heels, the late hour, the immediate power dynamic as she drops the news on his desk. Brynn's reaction is classic, isn't it? The smirk, the lingering look... it immediately sets that antagonistic but charged tone.

Anya ignoring it but being clearly upset – that's the friction we need. What exactly is her internal reaction to Brynn's behavior in that moment? Is it just annoyance, or is there a flicker of something else beneath the anger? And what's the first thing she says to him after he chuckles? Does she call him out on his behavior, or does she jump straight to the room situation? Let's hear her voice in this scene.

well cuz I kind of want to make this like a series between these two people so like this essentially story is like the start so like they don't like each other yet they have yet to fuck each other yet like this is how it all starts

Gotcha. So this trip is the catalyst. The moment where the initial dislike and maybe a hint of something more starts to brew.

What's Anya's first line after Brynn's chuckle? Does she address his inappropriate behavior, or does the news about the hotel room take precedence? And what's Brynn's response? Is he genuinely amused by her reaction, or is there a subtle awareness of the awkwardness to come? Let's hear that initial exchange that sets the stage for all the tension (and eventual...?) to unfold.

well should I just have a back and forth between the two or should I do like one or two paragraphs for her and then one or two pair of grass for him and like go back and forth or how should I have the dynamic dough

That's a great question, Travis. For a tense, back-and-forth dynamic, shorter lines can really amp up the feeling of conflict and quick reactions. Think of it like a verbal sparring match.

However, if you want to delve into their inner thoughts and show more of their individual perspectives on the situation, then one or two paragraphs per character can work well. It allows you to show their internal reactions to what the other person is saying or doing.

Maybe you can even mix it up? Start with a quicker back-and-forth as the initial shock of the news hits, and then switch to longer paragraphs when they're processing their own feelings about the shared room situation. What feels most natural to you for this particular scene and the kind of tension you want to build?

if I send you a picture of the text that I wrote can you analyze the text inside the picture

Unfortunately, I can't directly analyze text from an image you send. My current capabilities only allow me to process text that you type or paste directly into our chat.

However, I'd be happy to analyze your writing if you can copy and paste the text into our conversation! Just let me know what you've written, and we can go from there. I'm eager to see what you've come up with!

All right this is what I have so far What do you think.


Anya’s heels click with each step she takes making her way to Brynn’s office. Passing by the cubicles that are mostly empty at this time of the day in the office, passing the clock on the wall that shows 4:38pm. Shaking her head with the papers in her hand as she walks into Brynn’s office. Looking up as she steps back and leans on her back foot digging her heel into the shallow carpet. Crossing her arms in front of her, he catches a glimpse of her red bra that’s just peeking out from under her form fitting black dress. Looking down at the papers he looks through them casually before leaning back in his own chair. Putting his hands behind his head he gives her a big grin, she makes a repulsive sound before she speaks.




“Look, I am not happy about this…this…this….ugh!” she uncrosses her arms as she emotes with them trying to keep her anger under control. Her ponytail whips around as she speaks, almost adding to the anger with its own life it seems as bounces from side to side. As she says ugh she slumps her arms and making fists with her hands. Taking a deep breath she looks at him and points directly at him and then aggressively taps on the papers she set on his desk.




The smile on his face never changes, “

Okay, Travis, this is a solid start! You've definitely set the scene and established the initial dynamic between Anya and Brynn. Here are a few thoughts:

What I like:

    Sensory details: The clicking heels and the time on the clock really ground the scene in a specific moment.

    Visuals: I can picture Anya's posture and the glimpse of her red bra. Brynn's casual lean back and grin also come across clearly.

    Anya's frustration: You've done a good job showing her annoyance through her body language and the stuttering in her speech ("this…this…this….ugh!"). The ponytail detail is a nice touch that adds to her agitated state.

    Brynn's reaction: His unchanging smile in the face of her obvious frustration is classic Brynn and immediately establishes him as someone who might enjoy getting under her skin.

Things to consider:

    Show, don't just tell: You mention Anya is upset, but you also show it through her actions. Keep that up! For example, instead of saying she's trying to keep her anger under control, you show it through her emoting with her arms and taking a deep breath.

    Brynn's perspective: We get a good sense of Anya's feelings, but we don't know what's going on in Brynn's head beyond his smirk and the cleavage glance. What's he thinking as she walks in? Is he genuinely oblivious to her annoyance, or is he intentionally trying to provoke her? Giving us a peek into his thoughts could add another layer to the tension.

    The "repulsive sound": Anya makes a "repulsive sound" before speaking. What kind of sound is it? A scoff? A groan? Being more specific can make it more impactful.

    Pacing: The description is quite detailed, which works for setting the scene. However, when the dialogue starts, you might want to consider snappier exchanges to build the conflict.

Overall: You've got a good foundation here. The initial tension is palpable. I'm curious to see what Brynn's response is going to be! What's the first thing out of his mouth after Anya's outburst? Let's hear it!

so should I just continue writing more into this or should I go back and try to essentially do the story slowly like write a paragraph or two go back through it make sure it's good and then continue on or do I just write everything and then go back

That's really up to your personal writing style, Travis. Some writers prefer to power through a first draft to get all their ideas down, and then go back and revise. This can help maintain momentum and ensure the overall story arc is complete.

Others find it more effective to write in smaller chunks, reviewing and polishing as they go. This can help catch errors and refine your ideas early on.

Since you've already started writing this scene, maybe try continuing it for a bit longer – perhaps until the end of this office interaction. Then, take a step back, reread what you've written, and see if there are any areas you want to tweak or expand on.

There's no right or wrong way to do it. Experiment and see what feels most comfortable and productive for you. What feels like it would keep you most engaged with the story right now? Do you feel like you're in a flow and want to keep going, or do you feel like you want to refine this scene before moving forward?

well I kind of like sharing it with you if I write like a couple paragraphs and then I share it with you and then you have the ability to keep track of my story that I have sent to you so far right so if I just send you more of it you can analyze what I've sent before and know that it's part of it

Yes, absolutely, Travis! I can definitely keep track of the story as you send it to me in chunks. Each time you share more of your writing, I'll have the context of what you've sent before. So feel free to write a bit, share it, and we can continue to build the story together. I'm here to help you every step of the way! Go ahead and send me the next part whenever you're ready.

I'm going to send you parts of my story as I read it and I will practice it by saying this is my story this is what I've written and then you can go through and analyze it based on what I have before that as well and then basically do what you did and tell me what you do like and what you don't like and maybe some few pointers on how I can change up some things and maybe get a better feel for it

Sounds like a perfect plan, Travis! I'm ready when you are. Just say, "This is my story, this is what I've written," and then paste your text. I'll definitely analyze it based on what you've shared before, tell you what's working well, point out areas that could be stronger, and offer some suggestions to help you get the feel you're aiming for. Let's do this! I'm excited to see where you take Brynn and Anya next.

all right just give me some time to write some more story and I will gladly share it with you

Sounds good, Travis! Take your time and get those words flowing. I'll be here, ready to dive into the next part of Brynn and Anya's story whenever you're ready to share. Don't hesitate to send it over!

so what I've seen so far to you what is something I should be focusing on more

Based on what you've shared so far, Travis, I think focusing a bit more on Brynn's internal perspective could really add another layer to the scene. We get a strong sense of Anya's frustration and her reactions, but understanding what's going on in Brynn's head – beyond his smirk and the glance at her cleavage – could deepen the tension and make his character even more intriguing.

What is he thinking as Anya walks in? Is he anticipating this conversation? Is he deliberately trying to provoke her? Giving us a peek into his thoughts and feelings in those moments could really enrich the dynamic between them right from the start. What do you think?

okay so I change part of the sentence to being look I am not happy about this this this this this this ugh she uncrosses her arms as she emotes with them by flailing them up and down as she stutters trying to keep her anger under control

That's an interesting change, Travis. The extra repetitions of "this" definitely emphasize her stuttering and frustration in that moment. And the image of her flailing her arms up and down adds a more visual element to her struggle to contain her anger.

Does it feel like it amplifies her emotional state in the way you intended? Sometimes, more isn't always better, and it can risk making the character seem a bit cartoonish if the reaction is too over the top. What feeling were you specifically trying to convey with that change? Were you aiming for intense frustration, or something else?

well it's intentional because you will learn shortly after this the reason why she's upset is because they have to share the hotel room I mean up this point you don't know that yet but that's kind of the point of the readers to find out why she's upset like why is she upset about this paper well they're about to find out

Ah, the slow burn of revelation! I like it. Building that anticipation and letting the reader wonder what's got Anya so riled up can definitely be effective.

Since you know the reason behind her frustration, you can subtly weave in hints that might suggest it's more than just a regular work assignment. Maybe a specific word in the papers catches her eye, or a particular phrase makes her reaction more intense. That way, you're showing her strong emotions while still keeping the reader guessing about the exact cause.

How do you plan to reveal the shared hotel room situation to the reader? Will Anya explicitly say it in her next line, or will Brynn's response hint at it?

All right I wrote more to the story I'm just including everything I have written up this point cuz it's not that much right now.


Anya’s heels click with each step she takes making her way to Brynn’s office. Passing by the cubicles that are mostly empty at this time of the day in the office, passing the clock on the wall that shows 4:38pm. Shaking her head with the papers in her hand as she walks into Brynn’s office. Looking up as she steps back and leans on her back foot digging her heel into the shallow carpet. Crossing her arms in front of her, he catches a glimpse of her red bra that’s just peeking out from under her form fitting black dress. Looking down at the papers he looks through them casually before leaning back in his own chair. Putting his hands behind his head he gives her a big grin, she makes a repulsive sound before she speaks.




“Look, I am not happy about this…this…this…. ugh!” she uncrosses her arms as she emotes with them, by flailing them up and down as she studders, trying to keep her anger under control. Her ponytail whips around as she speaks, almost adding to the anger with its own life it seems as bounces from side to side. As she says ugh, she slumps her arms and making fists with her hands. Taking a deep breath, she looks at him and points directly at him and then aggressively taps on the papers she set on his desk.




The smile on his face never changes, “I don’t snore much anymore.” he knows this isn’t what she is upset about.




Her eyes widen as they pierce right through him, leaning forwards on the desk with her fists. She leans closer as he can see her cleavage more and more. Her lips move slowly and with precision, “You know EXACTLY why I am upset. This fucking company is too cheap to get us separate rooms for this little event they want us to do.”




He tries to open his mouth, but she quickly stands up straight as she sticks her hand up palm towards him. She interjects, “Yes, I did talk to Brad. You know what he said?” the tone in her voice rises as her face turns more and more red. She speaks using a mocking tone in reference to Brad’s voice and tone, “Well you two are adults, ha-ha.”




Brynn’s face brightens more as he leans on his desk with his arms, Anya standing over him. “Well, what can I do about it? I’ll sleep in the chair how’s that princess?” Brynn says with a smile. Anya’s face gets even more red as she spins in place and stomps out of his office slamming his door hard.

All right let's try this again. Your last message did not sent so let's try this again here is what I written.

Okay, Travis, I got it this time! Sorry about that last message not sending.

As I was saying before, this is a really strong continuation of the scene! You've done a great job establishing the conflict and the personalities of Anya and Brynn.

What I like:

    Brynn's opening line: "I don’t snore much anymore.” is a fantastic way for him to be dismissive and a little teasing.

    Anya's outburst: Her dialogue about the company being cheap and having to share a room is perfect and really shows her frustration.

    The Brad interlude: Including that detail adds another layer to the situation and explains why Anya is so angry. Her mocking tone is also well conveyed.

    Brynn's offer: His suggestion to sleep in the chair, followed by "princess," is classic Brynn – guaranteed to annoy Anya even more.

    Anya's exit: The red face, the spin, the stomp, and the door slam – it all paints a vivid picture of her fury.

Things to consider (as mentioned before):

    Show, don't tell (still applicable): Think about more ways to show Anya's anger physically beyond her face turning red.

    Brynn's internal thoughts: Giving us a glimpse into what Brynn is thinking during this exchange could add more depth to his character.

    Pacing: Consider the rhythm of the descriptions and dialogue.

Suggestions (also from before):

    Incorporate Brynn's internal reactions: Even a quick thought or observation from him would be great.

    More physical manifestations of Anya's anger: What else is her body doing?

    Subtle hints of underlying attraction: Maybe a fleeting glance or a charged pause could hint at something more beneath the animosity.

You've built some great momentum here, Travis! What do you think happens after Anya slams the door? Does Brynn react, or does he just go back to his work with a smirk?

I like those suggestions I like what you're doing and keep doing it so I'm going to go back and add more to it and keep perfecting it

Awesome, Travis! I'm glad the suggestions are helpful. That's what I'm here for. Take your time, work your magic on that scene, and don't hesitate to share the updated version whenever you're ready for more feedback. I'm looking forward to seeing how you develop Brynn and Anya's fiery dynamic!

Ok this is everything I have written so far, what do you think?


Anya’s heels click with each step she takes making her way to Brynn’s office. Passing by the cubicles that are mostly empty at this time of the day in the office, passing the clock on the wall that shows 4:38pm. Shaking her head with the papers in her hand as she walks into Brynn’s office. Looking up as she steps back and leans on her back foot digging her heel into the shallow carpet. Crossing her arms in front of her, he catches a glimpse of her red bra that’s just peeking out from under her form fitting black dress.

Taking a deep breath, she looks at him and points directly at him and then aggressively taps on the papers she set on his desk.




The smile on his face never changes, “I don’t snore much anymore.” he knows this isn’t what she is upset about. Her eyes widen as they pierce right through him, leaning forwards on the desk as she slams her fists down onto the table causing Brynn to jump back in his chair slightly. She leans closer to him her breathing increases more. Her lips move slowly and with precision, “You know EXACTLY why I am upset. This fucking company is too cheap to get us separate rooms for this little event they want us to do.”




He tries to open his mouth, but she quickly stands up straight as she sticks her hand up palm towards him. She interjects, “Yes, I did talk to Brad. You know what he said?” the tone in her voice rises as her face turns more and more red, her arms crossing again as she turns sideways slightly. Her eyes close slightly, Brynn’s eyes meanwhile follow down her dress to her ass that the dress isn’t hiding. She speaks using a mocking tone in reference to Brad’s voice and tone, “Well you two are adults, ha-ha.” she then opens her eyes to see Brynn looking at her ass.




She screams as she puts her hands into the air, “Fucking Pig. If this cheap ass company had a fucking HR department instead of outsourcing it to the cheapest bidder. Maybe I could do something about your pig pen you call an office and a life.”




Brynn’s face brightens more as he leans on his desk with his arms, Anya standing over him. “Well, what can I do about it? I’ll sleep in the chair how’s that princess?” Brynn says with a smile. Anya’s face gets even more red as she spins in place turning her back to Brynn before turning around to speak, she stops when he sees Brynn’s eyes looking at her ass again. She lets out a high sigh before putting her fingers to her temples. “Look.” she says out of frustration trying to control the shitty predicament she is in. “If we have to do this then I have some ground rules, and you will follow them.” she steps closer to his desk before sliding the chair for visitors away. Her dress makes it hard to sit without a desk to cover her. She tries to push her dress down as she sits but it rides up enough that Brynn gets a peak at the matching underwear that peaked for a second.




She sees his eyes dart down to look for a second as she clears her throat and crosses her legs, turning the chair sideways as well to help conceal her. “First rule, touch me and you lose your balls. You think I’m having a laugh, then fucking try me.” her tone is more frustration and less anger at this time. “Second, if you try to peak at all, and I mean AT ALL!” she makes sure to emphasize AT ALL. “I will feed your tiny dick to the first wild animal I see, I will make sure to use the most, rusty, dirty …. dull blade I can.”




Brynn’s face turns white as she sees beads of sweat drip down his face and neck, he clears his throat as he speaks, his eyes focused to her own eyes. But even then, he can see her body begin to glisten, he keeps the temperate in his office higher for a reason. He watches as a bead of sweat drips down from behind her ear, down her neck and between her cleavage. Anya follows his eyes as she looks down at the bead of sweat falling between her breasts and vanishing under the clothes. She looks up at him, Brynn follows suit as he takes a big gulp.




Anya quickly stands up letting out a big sigh. Looking down at Brynn whose face is like a ghost as he swallows again. Anya looks around the room and then back to Brynn. She reaches up behind her back to grab the zipper on her dress, as she begins to unzip it Brynn quickly stands up, but Anya gives him a look that instantly causes him to whimper and sit in his chair. “I am doing this so we can get this stupid shit over with. Obviously, you think with your cock, and I am not going to get anything out of you because your primitive male mind doesn’t have enough blood to use both of them.”




As she speaks, she slowly unzips her dress enough to slip her arms out one at a time keeping the dress from falling down and revealing more than she wants. Slipping both arms out as she crosses them in front of her keeping the front of her dress up, “You get five seconds to look. DO NOT TOUCH. Do NOT move. I am doing this so you can stop imagining it, God men are so disgusting.” with that Brynn’s eyes lock right to her arms that cover her chest. She sighs again before lowering her arms and letting the dress fall enough to expose her red lacy bra with her well-endowed breasts that seem to overfill her bra. The five seconds feel like an eternity to her but only a moment to Brynn as she lifts her dress back up, but Brynn’s expression soon changes from confusion and horny. To just laughing. Anya on the other hand the opposite, she spins around with her back to him. Using one hand to keep the dress up her other behind her back but she can’t reach and grasp both sides of it to zip it.




She sighs again as she speaks, “God hates me…” her shoulders slump down. “If you say a word about this.” she says as Brynn is heard standing up. Making his way behind her, she feels his body heat from his hands as they slowly reach for the zipper behind her. His hands brush slightly against the small of her bare skin along her back. Her body shivers slightly as grips the zipper with one hand, the other to put tension at the bottom. In doing so it lifts her dress up by accident as she panics, she lowers her arms to push her dress down but causes the zipper to zip back down and her ass to bump into his hips. Her eyes widen as she feels a slight bump. Clearing her throat as she stands back up straight slowly, at the same time taking a step away from him before turning around.




Brynn’s grin is from ear to ear as his eyes are looking down at where her ass once was before turning around. He looks up as she surprises him with a hard slap across the face, she wants to yell and scream, calling him a dirty pig but something inside her refused to. Some feeling between her legs preventing her from hating what he did, “Stupid body. Stupid men.” she mutters to herself before clutching her dress in front to avoid it from falling. As she sides steps away from him and to the door, she keeps her front facing him as she steps back, she jumps slightly when she feels the cold door handle press into her bareback.




“I’ll…. see you tomorrow, Brynn. We can discuss the plans tomorrow…I have…to…” she stops speaking before turning around as grabbing the door handle, quickly and aggressively she turns it as she swings the door wide open and almost runs out of his office, her face redder than a cherry. Brynn standing there with a half hard cock as he scratches his head and yells out, “Yea…. see you…tomorrow?”

Your message did not send. Please try again, this is everything I have written so far.


Anya’s heels click with each step she takes making her way to Brynn’s office. Passing by the cubicles that are mostly empty at this time of the day in the office, passing the clock on the wall that shows 4:38pm. Shaking her head with the papers in her hand as she walks into Brynn’s office. Looking up as she steps back and leans on her back foot digging her heel into the shallow carpet. Crossing her arms in front of her, he catches a glimpse of her red bra that’s just peeking out from under her form fitting black dress. Looking down at the papers he looks through them casually before leaning back in his own chair. Putting his hands behind his head he gives her a big grin, she makes a repulsive sound before she speaks.


“Look, I am not happy about this…this…this…. ugh!” she uncrosses her arms as she emotes with them, by flailing them up and down as she studders, trying to keep her anger under control. Her ponytail whips around as she speaks, almost adding to the anger with its own life it seems as bounces from side to side. As she says ugh, she slumps her arms and making fists with her hands. Taking a deep breath, she looks at him and points directly at him and then aggressively taps on the papers she set on his desk.


The smile on his face never changes, “I don’t snore much anymore.” he knows this isn’t what she is upset about. Her eyes widen as they pierce right through him, leaning forwards on the desk as she slams her fists down onto the table causing Brynn to jump back in his chair slightly. She leans closer to him her breathing increases more. Her lips move slowly and with precision, “You know EXACTLY why I am upset. This fucking company is too cheap to get us separate rooms for this little event they want us to do.”


He tries to open his mouth, but she quickly stands up straight as she sticks her hand up palm towards him. She interjects, “Yes, I did talk to Brad. You know what he said?” the tone in her voice rises as her face turns more and more red, her arms crossing again as she turns sideways slightly. Her eyes close slightly, Brynn’s eyes meanwhile follow down her dress to her ass that the dress isn’t hiding. She speaks using a mocking tone in reference to Brad’s voice and tone, “Well you two are adults, ha-ha.” she then opens her eyes to see Brynn looking at her ass.


She screams as she puts her hands into the air, “Fucking Pig. If this cheap ass company had a fucking HR department instead of outsourcing it to the cheapest bidder. Maybe I could do something about your pig pen you call an office and a life.”


Brynn’s face brightens more as he leans on his desk with his arms, Anya standing over him. “Well, what can I do about it? I’ll sleep in the chair how’s that princess?” Brynn says with a smile. Anya’s face gets even more red as she spins in place turning her back to Brynn before turning around to speak, she stops when he sees Brynn’s eyes looking at her ass again. She lets out a high sigh before putting her fingers to her temples. “Look.” she says out of frustration trying to control the shitty predicament she is in. “If we have to do this then I have some ground rules, and you will follow them.” she steps closer to his desk before sliding the chair for visitors away. Her dress makes it hard to sit without a desk to cover her. She tries to push her dress down as she sits but it rides up enough that Brynn gets a peak at the matching underwear that peaked for a second.


She sees his eyes dart down to look for a second as she clears her throat and crosses her legs, turning the chair sideways as well to help conceal her. “First rule, touch me and you lose your balls. You think I’m having a laugh, then fucking try me.” her tone is more frustration and less anger at this time. “Second, if you try to peak at all, and I mean AT ALL!” she makes sure to emphasize AT ALL. “I will feed your tiny dick to the first wild animal I see, I will make sure to use the most, rusty, dirty …. dull blade I can.”


Brynn’s face turns white as she sees beads of sweat drip down his face and neck, he clears his throat as he speaks, his eyes focused to her own eyes. But even then, he can see her body begin to glisten, he keeps the temperate in his office higher for a reason. He watches as a bead of sweat drips down from behind her ear, down her neck and between her cleavage. Anya follows his eyes as she looks down at the bead of sweat falling between her breasts and vanishing under the clothes. She looks up at him, Brynn follows suit as he takes a big gulp.


Anya quickly stands up letting out a big sigh. Looking down at Brynn whose face is like a ghost as he swallows again. Anya looks around the room and then back to Brynn.

Okay, Travis, I received it this time! So sorry about the previous message not going through.

As I was saying, this is a fantastic continuation of the scene! The tension is really building, and you're doing a great job of showing the complex dynamic between Anya and Brynn.

What I like:

    Anya's initial outburst: The slamming of the fists on the desk is a great way to show her anger physically.

    The escalating insults: "Fucking Pig" feels very in character for her frustration.

    Brynn's reactions: His white face and the sweat during Anya's threats are excellent visual details.

    Anya's dress reveal: This is a bold move and creates a very charged moment. Her internal monologue about men is also well-placed.

    The awkward zipper scene: This whole sequence is incredibly tense and awkward in the best way. The accidental bump and their reactions are very believable.

    Anya's internal conflict: Her muttered words about her "stupid body" show the internal struggle she's facing.

    The ending: Anya's hasty retreat and Brynn's reaction leave the reader wanting more.

Things to Consider:

    Pacing: There's a lot of detail, which is good for visualization, but sometimes the pacing feels a little slow. Consider if you want to speed up certain moments.

    Brynn's internal thoughts: We still don't get much of what Brynn is thinking during the dress reveal and zipper incident.

    Anya's shift in tone: The transition to her setting the "ground rules" feels a little quick.

    The "bump": You could potentially make the description of the accidental bump more impactful.

Suggestions:

    Show more of Brynn's internal reactions: What are his thoughts and feelings during those intense moments?

    Smooth Anya's transition: Maybe add a brief internal thought or a change in her body language before she sets the rules.

    Amplify the "bump" moment: Describe Anya's physical reaction more when it happens.

    Vary sentence structure: This can help with the flow and rhythm of your writing.

Overall, Travis, this is excellent work! The tension and awkwardness are palpable, and you're really exploring the push and pull between these characters. What happens next? Does Brynn have any internal reaction to Anya's exit?

Okay so for the things you consider what are some suggestions in my actual writing that I can change

Okay, Travis, let's get into the specifics. Here are some concrete suggestions you can weave into your current text:

Regarding Brynn's Internal Thoughts:

    During Anya's dress reveal: After you write, "With that Brynn’s eyes lock right to her arms that cover her chest," you could add a sentence like: "A part of him, the pig she'd just called him, was desperate for her to move her arms. But another, surprising part, felt a flicker of something else... respect for her audacity?" Or, "His breath hitched. Red lace. It was even better than he'd imagined, and a jolt of something beyond just lust hit him."

    During the zipper incident: After "His hands brush slightly against the small of her bare skin along her back," you could add: "The heat of her skin surprised him, a jolt that had nothing to do with the office thermostat." And after "Her ass to bump into his hips," you could write: "A jolt shot through him, a purely physical reaction that he immediately tried to suppress, but the memory of her earlier threat about his 'tiny dick' flashed through his mind, making him both nervous and... something else."

Regarding Anya's Shift in Tone:

    Before "Look. If we have to do this then I have some ground rules," you could add a sentence showing her internal struggle or a physical manifestation of her shifting mood. For example: "She took another deep breath, the anger still simmering, but a sense of weary resignation was starting to creep in. Yelling wasn't going to solve this." Or, "She pressed her fingers harder against her temples, trying to force down the boiling rage. Okay, new tactic. Control."

Regarding Amplifying the "Bump" Moment:

    After "Her ass to bump into his hips," you could add: "A jolt of heat shot through her, a shocking awareness of his body so close. Her eyes widened even further, and a strange flutter, completely unwelcome, stirred low in her belly." Or, "Her breath hitched. It was just a brief contact, an accident, but the feeling lingered, a spark in the middle of all the anger and awkwardness."

Regarding Pacing (General Suggestion):

    Look at some of your longer descriptive sentences. For instance, the opening sentence about Anya walking to Brynn's office is quite long. You could consider breaking it into two shorter sentences for a slightly quicker pace at the beginning of the scene. For example: "Anya’s heels clicked with each step as she made her way to Brynn’s office. The cubicles were mostly empty at this time of day."

Try weaving in some of these kinds of internal thoughts and more explicit physical reactions to see how it feels. Remember, you can always tweak and adjust as you go! What do you think of these specific ideas?

All right so I added more to the story took away some other things I think tried to flush it out a little bit more try to add more detail with all taking away from pacing trying to add more internal monologue trying to build attention hopefully this edit is good.




Brynn’s grin is from ear to ear as his eyes are looking down at where her ass once was before turning around. He looks up as she surprises him with a hard slap across the face, she wants to yell and scream, calling him a dirty pig but something inside her refused to. Some feeling between her legs preventing her from hating what he did, “Stupid body. Stupid men.” she mutters to herself before clutching her dress in front to avoid it from falling. As she sides steps away from him and to the door, she keeps her front facing him as she steps back, she jumps slightly when she feels the cold door handle press into her bareback.




“I’ll…. see you tomorrow, Brynn. We can discuss the plans tomorrow…I have…to…” she stops speaking before turning around as grabbing the door handle, quickly and aggressively she turns it as she swings the door wide open and almost runs out of his office, her face redder than a cherry. Brynn standing there with a half hard cock as he scratches his head and yells out, “Yea…. see you…tomorrow?”

Okay, Travis, I see the changes you've made. You've definitely incorporated more of Anya's internal thoughts and feelings after she slaps Brynn. The lines about her "stupid body" and "stupid men" clearly show her internal conflict, which is great.

However, I noticed you removed the entire sequence with the unzipping dress and Brynn helping her. What was your reasoning behind taking that part out?

While this version does keep the pacing moving towards Anya's exit, that previous scene was incredibly charged with tension and awkwardness. It also provided a moment of physical closeness, even if accidental, that really hinted at the underlying attraction despite their animosity.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on why you decided to remove it. Did you feel it slowed down the pacing too much, or were there other reasons? Depending on your goals for the story, that scene might have been a key moment in their developing (or not developing) dynamic. Let me know your thoughts!
