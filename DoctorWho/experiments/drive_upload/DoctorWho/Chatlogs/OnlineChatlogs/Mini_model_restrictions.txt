Mini model restrictions

It won't let me send it any more messages on the other model and is forcing me to use the mini model.

It looks like you're currently facing an issue with the mini model, and it's preventing you from sending more messages. To troubleshoot this:

1. **Switching Models**: If the platform is restricting you to the mini model, it could be a limitation on the message length or complexity, especially if you're hitting the token limit or encountering restrictions on usage. Since you're working with extensive scripts and logs, this could be triggering the limitation.

2. **Workaround**: I suggest breaking down large scripts into smaller segments when interacting with the mini model. If you need to continue work on the full scripts, you can use a separate file or chunk them into smaller pieces for easier handling.

If you're looking to resolve this issue or continue with a specific task, feel free to let me know how you'd like to proceed!
