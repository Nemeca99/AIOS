Unified Field Theory - RZDA/RISA Integration
============================================

This module implements the unified field theory where:
- 0/0 = UNIT OF 1 (oneness) = POTENTIAL to be any number
- F = ma (top)
- E = mc¬≤ (bottom)
- FE = A/c¬≤ (unified equation)
- Mass cancels internally but not the EFFECT (gravity)
