# Strategic GitHub Release Plan for UML Calculator

## Objective
Structure the GitHub repository to showcase the tool's capabilities while protecting core intellectual property, designed to attract potential investors and collaborators.

## Repository Structure

### Public Components (to be shared on GitHub)
1. **Basic Calculator Functionality**
   - Standard mathematical operations
   - Basic function plotting
   - User interface framework
   - Documentation of basic features

2. **Demo UML Capabilities**
   - Sample UML diagram generation (limited scope)
   - Example diagrams and outputs
   - Technical overview documentation

3. **Code Structure**
   - Well-organized codebase with clear architecture
   - Extensible design patterns
   - Professional documentation
   - Requirements and setup instructions

### Protected Components (NOT to be included)
1. **Core RIS Algorithm Implementation**
   - Replace with simplified version that demonstrates concept
   - Keep proprietary rules and mathematical foundations private

2. **Advanced UML Generation Logic**
   - Include only basic UML generation capabilities
   - Withhold advanced mapping algorithms

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Reserve enterprise integration features

## Implementation Strategy

### Code Modification for Public Release
1. **Create Abstraction Layer**
   - Add interfaces that hide implementation details
   - Document extension points

2. **Replace Proprietary Algorithms**
   - Substitute simplified versions of key algorithms
   - Add comments indicating where "enterprise features" would extend functionality

3. **Limit Functionality**
   - Cap performance or feature set
   - Include clear messaging about available enterprise features

### Documentation Strategy
1. **Highlight Capabilities**
   - Showcase impressive outputs and results
   - Demonstrate real use cases

2. **Clear "Community vs. Enterprise" Distinction**
   - Create feature comparison table
   - Explain licensing model

3. **Contact Information**
   - Provide clear path for business inquiries
   - Include "enterprise licensing available" messaging

## GitHub Repository Preparation

### README.md Focus
- Focus on the problem being solved
- Show visual examples of outputs
- Clearly indicate enterprise vs. community features
- Include contact information for business inquiries

### License Strategy
- Use appropriate restrictive license
- Consider "Source Available" vs truly "Open Source"
- Include patent and commercial use restrictions where appropriate

### Sample Code and Examples
- Provide enough examples to demonstrate value
- Include screenshots/images of advanced features
- Create tutorials that showcase the potential

## Confidentiality Measures
- Review all code comments for sensitive information
- Remove developer notes and internal references
- Establish clear contribution guidelines
- Consider code obfuscation for critical but included components
