# UML Demo Pack ‚Äì Recursive Symbolic Calculator (Preview)

**Author:** Travis Miner  
**System:** UML (Universal Mathematical Language) + RIS (Recursive Integration System)  
**Purpose:** Provide a symbolic, recursive math demo for validation and inspection  
**Status:** Core interpreter and compression engine protected

---

## üåê What This Is

This demo pack contains:

- A symbolic math system that uses recursive bracketed notation
- A sample shell that mimics the calculator experience
- Manual test outputs to verify results
- A conversion guide to map between UML and classical math

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a **preview-only release**.  
The full interpreter, recursion engine, symbolic compression, and Lyra AI integration are **not** included. This is intended to show that:

- The UML notation is functional and testable  
- The RIS logic behaves consistently  
- Manual verification is possible using the guide provided
