## Removals

### 2025-10-10 - utils_core cleanup

#### 1. utils_core/extra/refactor_cores.py
**What it did:** Helper script to analyze duplicate code patterns across core modules and generate refactoring suggestions. Used to demonstrate how to eliminate duplicate initialization code by using shared utilities.

**Why removed:** Depends on deleted modules (`utils_core.core_utilities`, `utils_core.system_initializer`) that were part of an old refactoring attempt. The refactoring has been completed differently, and this demo script is no longer needed or functional.

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Folder:** utils_core/extra  
**Status:** Obsolete helper script

---

#### 2. utils_core/extra/refactored_example_backup_core.py
**What it did:** Example/demo file generated by refactor_cores.py showing how backup_core could be refactored to use the old CoreSystemBase pattern.

**Why removed:** Auto-generated example file that depends on deleted modules. Not actual production code, just an example output from the refactoring helper script above.

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Folder:** utils_core/extra  
**Status:** Auto-generated demo file

---

#### 3. utils_core/extra/psycho_semantic_rag_system.py
**What it did:** Advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system with "Triple-Point Triangulation" for detecting error signals in conversations. Attempted to analyze psychological context and emotional state to improve AI responses. 739 lines of complex RAG logic.

**Why removed:** Depends on deleted module (`luna_core.luna_core` in old structure). This was an experimental RAG system that hasn't been integrated into the current architecture. The functionality exists in better form in carma_core's fractal cache system.

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Folder:** utils_core/extra  
**Status:** Experimental/unintegrated code
