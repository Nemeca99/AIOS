### 2025-10-10 - utils_core Import Errors

#### Issue 1: utils_core/extra/refactor_cores.py - Import Error
**Problem:** File tried to import `utils_core.core_utilities` and `utils_core.system_initializer` which no longer exist after refactoring.

**Root Cause:** Helper/demo script from old refactoring attempt that wasn't updated when modules were restructured.

**Fix:** File removed - was obsolete helper script not needed for production. See FILE_REMOVAL_LOG.md entry #1.

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Git Commit:** e8218be01

#### Issue 2: utils_core/extra/refactored_example_backup_core.py - Import Error  
**Problem:** Auto-generated example file with same import issues as above.

**Root Cause:** Generated by refactor_cores.py script, not actual production code.

**Fix:** File removed - was auto-generated example. See FILE_REMOVAL_LOG.md entry #2.

#### Issue 3: utils_core/extra/psycho_semantic_rag_system.py - Import Error
**Problem:** Experimental RAG system tried to import `luna_core.luna_core` from old module structure.

**Root Cause:** 739-line experimental RAG system never integrated into current architecture after luna_core refactoring.

**Fix:** File removed - experimental code superseded by carma_core's fractal cache. See FILE_REMOVAL_LOG.md entry #3.
