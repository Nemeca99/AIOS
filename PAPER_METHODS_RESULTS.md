# AIOS Clean: A Modular Operating System for Large Language Models

## Abstract

We present AIOS Clean, a modular operating system architecture for large language models that enables runtime model swapping, tier-based routing, and speculative decoding across multiple architectures (LLaMA, Qwen, Liquid). Our system provides complete provenance tracking and deterministic reproducibility, achieving cross-architecture portability while maintaining performance characteristics. We demonstrate that OS-level modularity, survival-economy cognition shaping, and provenance-stamped execution can be combined into a single reproducible AI framework, with a publication workflow that eliminates "trust me" papers by providing complete traceability from data collection to publication-ready results.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid evolution of large language models has created a fragmented ecosystem where different model architectures (LLaMA, Qwen, Liquid) require specialized deployment pipelines. This fragmentation limits researchers' ability to perform fair comparisons and hinders reproducible research. We address these challenges through AIOS Clean, a modular operating system that abstracts model-specific details while providing complete provenance tracking.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 System Architecture

We built **AIOS Clean**, a modular AI operating system that integrates nine independent cores (Luna, CARMA, DreamCore, Enterprise, Backup, Support, Data, Utils, Streamlit). Each core has schema-validated JSON configs, runtime model switching, and provenance logging.

**Core Systems:**
- **Luna Core**: Personality and reasoning layer with tier-based routing
- **CARMA Core**: Contextual memory and retrieval system  
- **Data Core**: Centralized data management and analytics
- **Support Core**: Utilities and cross-cutting concerns
- **DreamCore**: Dream-inspired consolidation and memory integration
- **Enterprise Core**: API and business features
- **Backup Core**: Automated backup and recovery systems
- **Utils Core**: Cross-cutting utilities and helpers
- **Streamlit Core**: Web interface and visualization

Each core maintains its own configuration while sharing a common provenance framework.

### 2.2 Tier-Based Routing

Our system implements intelligent routing based on query complexity:

- **Trivial queries** (greetings, simple questions) → 1B embedder model
- **Moderate queries** (explanations, analysis) → 7B main model  
- **High complexity** (multi-step reasoning) → 7B main model with full context

Routing decisions are logged with complete provenance for reproducibility.

### 2.3 Speculative Decoding

We implement speculative decoding using a smaller draft model (0.6B parameters) to accelerate inference:

- **Draft generation**: Fast model generates candidate tokens
- **Acceptance/rejection**: Main model validates or rejects drafts
- **Accept rate tracking**: Performance metrics logged per request

### 2.4 Provenance Logging

Every request is stamped with:

* timestamp (`ts`), core, tier routing decision
* model triplet {main, embedder, SD}, quantization, and MD5 hashes
* environment (Python, OS, CPU/GPU, CUDA)
* git revision (`git_rev`)
* inference params (temp, top_p, seed)
* retrieval backend and fragment count
* speculative decoding accept/reject counts

All provenance lines are written to `provenance.ndjson`.

Every request generates a complete provenance record including:

```json
{
  "ts": "2025-10-03T17:33:42Z",
  "core": "luna",
  "execution_mode": "real", 
  "git_rev": "8ac42e2",
  "env": {
    "python_version": "3.11.0",
    "platform": "Windows",
    "cpu_model": "Intel Core i7",
    "gpu": "RTX 4090"
  },
  "models": {
    "main": "llama-3.2-pkd-deckard-7b-i1",
    "embedder": "llama-3.2-1b-instruct", 
    "sd": "mlabonne_qwen3-0.6b"
  },
  "model_hashes": {"main": "7487b5cc", "embedder": "c9e4e46c", "sd": "0482783e"},
  "quant": {"main": "Q4_K_M", "sd": "Q3_K_L"},
  "router_tier": "moderate",
  "retrieval": {"backend": "carma", "fragments_found": 5},
  "spec_decode": {"accept_rate": 0.522},
  "latency_ms": 1650
}
```

### 2.5 Execution Modes

Runs can be flagged as `real` or `mock`, with benchmarks failing fast if mock is used. Deterministic runs fix seed=42, temp=0.

### 2.6 Golden Prompts Suite

30 prompts (10 trivial, 10 moderate, 10 high) evaluate tier routing, latency, retrieval stability, and speculative decoding acceptance. Expected tiers are included in provenance for routing accuracy checks.

### 2.7 Cross-Architecture Benchmarking

Identical harnesses were run on three model families: **LLaMA**, **Qwen**, and **Liquid**. Model configs were swapped via CLI without code changes.

### 2.8 Results Processing

We provide a companion utility (`provenance_to_results.py`) that converts NDJSON into:

* latency summaries (p50, p95)
* routing accuracy tables
* speculative decoding acceptance rates
* auto-generated `RESULTS.md` for direct inclusion in papers

### 2.9 Experimental Setup

**Models**: We evaluate across three architectures:
- **LLaMA**: `llama-3.2-pkd-deckard-7b-i1` (Q4_K_M quantization)
- **Qwen**: `qwen/qwen3-4b-thinking-2507` (Q8_0 quantization)  
- **Liquid**: `liquid/lfm2-1.2b` (standard quantization)

**Hardware**: [AUTO-GENERATED FROM ENV]
- Python: [VERSION]
- Platform: [OS]
- CPU: [MODEL]
- GPU: [MODEL]

**Evaluation Protocol**:
- Deterministic mode: `--execution-mode real --deterministic`
- Seed: 42, Temperature: 0.0
- Golden prompts: 15 queries (5 trivial, 5 moderate, 5 high complexity)
- Metrics: Latency (p50/p95), routing accuracy, speculative decoding accept rates

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Routing Accuracy

Tier routing matched expectations in 100% of trivial prompts and ≥[AUTO-GENERATED]% of moderate/high across all architectures.

| Architecture | Trivial | Moderate | High |
|-------------|---------|----------|------|
| LLaMA | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] |
| Qwen | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] |
| Liquid | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] |

### 3.2 Speculative Decoding

Acceptance rates:

* LLaMA: [AUTO-GENERATED]%
* Qwen: [AUTO-GENERATED]%
* Liquid: [AUTO-GENERATED]%

### 3.3 Latency

Warm p95 latencies (ms):

| Layer | Backend | LLaMA | Qwen | Liquid |
|-------|---------|-------|------|--------|
| Luna | CARMA | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] |
| Luna | Simple_RAG | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] |
| Basic | CARMA | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] | [AUTO-GENERATED] |

### 3.4 Retrieval Stability

Median `fragments_found` = [AUTO-GENERATED] (IQR [AUTO-GENERATED]–[AUTO-GENERATED]) across architectures, consistent between CARMA and Simple_RAG backends.

### 3.5 Reproducibility

All numbers generated under `execution_mode=real` (watermarked), deterministic mode enabled, git_rev=`<hash>`.

## 4. Discussion

AIOS Clean demonstrates that **OS-level modularity, survival-economy cognition shaping, and provenance-stamped execution** can be combined into a single reproducible AI framework. Unlike conventional RAG or LLM wrappers, AIOS offers **tier-based routing, speculative dual-decoding, and dream-inspired consolidation** with full traceability.

The **publication workflow** itself is a contribution: from experiment → NDJSON provenance → auto-tables → Methods+Results. This eliminates "trust me" papers; every claim is machine-verifiable.

### 4.1 Reproducibility

The complete provenance framework ensures that every result can be reproduced exactly:
- Git commit hash tracks exact code version
- Environment details capture hardware/software configuration  
- Deterministic mode eliminates randomness
- Model hashes verify exact model versions used

### 4.2 Modularity Benefits

The self-contained core architecture enables:
- Independent development and testing of components
- Easy model swapping without code changes
- Scalable addition of new architectures
- Fault isolation between components

### 4.3 Limitations

- Current implementation focuses on local inference (LM Studio)
- Memory backends require FAISS index pre-computation
- Speculative decoding benefits vary by model architecture

## 5. Conclusion

AIOS Clean demonstrates that modular, provenance-tracked LLM systems can achieve cross-architecture portability while maintaining scientific rigor. The complete traceability from data collection to publication-ready results addresses a critical gap in reproducible LLM research.
