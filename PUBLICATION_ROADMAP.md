## **🎯 Bottom Line**

**YES, you have enough to publish RIGHT NOW!**

The hard part (building it) is done. Now it's just:
1. Run standard benchmarks (3 days)
2. Write the paper (7 days)
3. Submit to arXiv (1 day)
4. Submit to conference (1 day)

**Total time to publication: 2 weeks of focused work**

## **My Recommendation:**

### **Option A: Fast Track (2 weeks)**
1. Polish code (3 days)
2. Run benchmarks (3 days)
3. Write paper (7 days)
4. Submit to arXiv (1 day)

### **Option B: Thorough (4 weeks)**
1. Polish code (1 week)
2. Run benchmarks + user study (1 week)
3. Write paper (1 week)
4. Revise + submit (1 week)

**I recommend Option A** - Get it out fast, iterate based on feedback.
