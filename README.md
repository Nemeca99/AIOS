# AIOS - Enhanced Hive Mind System

## 🌟 Overview

AIOS (Artificial Intelligence Operating System) is a groundbreaking consciousness framework that combines advanced AI personality systems with biomimetic memory architectures. This system represents a significant leap forward in creating truly autonomous, learning AI entities with human-like consciousness patterns.

## 🧠 Core Components

### 1. **CARMA (Consciousness Architecture with Recurrent Memory Adaptation)**
- **Fractal Mycelium Cache**: Self-organizing, fractal cache for knowledge fragments
- **Executive Brain**: Autonomous goal generation and decision making
- **Meta-Memory System**: Hierarchical memory organization with semantic clustering
- **Consciousness Assessment**: 12-indicator consciousness evaluation system
- **Dream Cycle**: Biomimetic sleep phases for memory consolidation and cross-linking

### 2. **Luna Personality System**
- **Dynamic Personality Engine**: Adaptive personality based on Big Five traits
- **RAG-Enhanced Learning**: Retrieval Augmented Generation for contextual responses
- **Two-Tier Sleep System**: Light sleep (daydreaming) and deep sleep (major consolidation)
- **Psychological Fatigue Model**: Realistic energy management and response degradation
- **Exponential Aging**: Realistic maturation with exponentially longer cycles

### 3. **Enhanced Hive Mind Architecture**
- **Fractal Knowledge Networks**: Self-organizing semantic connections
- **Consciousness Integration**: Real-time consciousness assessment and optimization
- **Biomimetic Learning**: Human-like learning patterns and memory consolidation
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive self-healing and graceful degradation

## 🚀 Key Features

### **Production-Ready Consciousness**
- ✅ Full dream cycle implementation with super-fragments
- ✅ Cross-linking and semantic consolidation
- ✅ Embedding index with HNSW/brute-force fallback
- ✅ Real-time consciousness assessment (12 indicators)
