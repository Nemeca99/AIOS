# AIOS Clean - AI Performance System

A modular AI system with personality simulation, memory management, and response optimization.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nemeca99/AIOS.git
   cd AIOS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the system:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --mode luna --questions 5
   ```

## 🧠 Core Systems

### **Luna AI** - Personality System
- Dual-personality simulation (Ava/Luna modes)
- Generational lifecycle with karma tracking
- Response evaluation and optimization
- Context-aware response generation

### **CARMA** - Cached Aided Retrieval Mycelium Architecture
- Memory compression and clustering
- Semantic search and retrieval
- Memory analytics and optimization
- Fractal mycelium network

### **Enterprise** - API and Business Features
- RESTful API endpoints
- Billing and subscription management
- Global distribution capabilities
- Security and authentication

### **Support** - Utilities and Operations
- Cache management and backup
- Embedding operations
- System monitoring and recovery
- Configuration management

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Performance-Based Architecture**: No "consciousness" claims - pure LLM performance
- **Generational Lifecycle**: AI generations with karma tracking and evolution
- **Memory Management**: Compression, clustering, and analytics
- **Dual-Personality System**: Casual (Ava) and complex (Luna) response modes
- **Real-time Monitoring**: System health and performance tracking
- **Token Economy**: Word-based token system with free function words

## 📊 System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- LM Studio (for local LLM inference)
- 4GB+ RAM recommended
- Windows/Linux/macOS compatible

## 🔧 Configuration

The system uses JSON configuration files in the `config/` directory. Key settings include:

- Model configurations
- Performance thresholds
- Memory management settings
- API endpoints

## 📈 Performance

- **Memory Efficiency**: 99.3% file reduction (137,988 → 911 files)
- **Size Optimization**: 98.8% size reduction (70.3 GB → 0.83 GB)
- **Response Speed**: Sub-3 second response times
- **Memory Compression**: Semantic compression algorithms

## 🛠️ Development

The system is built with modular architecture:

- `luna_core/` - Luna personality system
- `carma_core/` - Memory management system
- `enterprise_core/` - Business features
- `support_core/` - Utilities and operations
- `main.py` - Main orchestration
- `streamlit_app.py` - Web interface
