# AIOS Validation Roadmap
**Moving from Internal Validation to External Evidence**

## Current Status (v1.0.0-prod)

### ✅ Internally Validated
- Modular architecture with swappable cores (component tests passing)
- Language→math routing operational (60/40 split, provenance-logged weights)
- CARMA memory functional (recall@5=100% on 10-case internal QA)
- Closed-loop infrastructure (hypotheses → adaptation → monitoring)
- Operations ready (CI/CD, SLO alerts, runbooks)
- Security implemented (PII redaction, GDPR deletion API, conv_id hashing)

### ⚠️ Awaiting External Validation
- Performance vs SOTA (no HELM/LongBench comparison)
- Scalability (local-only, no distributed deployment tested)
- Stress resilience (no formal load/chaos engineering)
- Security audit (implementation correct, but no third-party review)

---

## Validation Item 1: External Benchmarks

### Goal
Compare AIOS routing/quality against established benchmarks (HELM, LongBench, MT-Bench)

### Implementation Plan (v1.1)

**Step 1: HELM Integration**
```python
# tools/helm_eval.py
- Download HELM lite scenarios
- Run through Luna with provenance logging
- Measure: accuracy, latency, token efficiency
- Compare to reported HELM baselines
```

**Step 2: LongBench Comparison**
```python
# tools/longbench_eval.py  
- Use LongBench-E (English) subset
- Test: QA, summarization, code, math
- Measure retrieval quality (CARMA vs baseline)
- Report: precision@k, recall@k, F1
```

**Step 3: MT-Bench (Multi-Turn)**
```python
# tools/mtbench_eval.py
- Run 80 multi-turn conversations
- Measure: conversation coherence, routing stability
- Compare: AIOS adaptive vs fixed routing
```

**Success Criteria:**
- AIOS routing accuracy within 5% of SOTA on HELM
- CARMA recall within 10% of vector DB baseline on LongBench
- Conversation coherence >= baseline on MT-Bench

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  
**Deliverable:** `EXTERNAL_BENCHMARKS.md` with comparative tables

## Validation Item 2: Load & Chaos Testing

### Goal
Establish error budgets and validate resilience under stress

### Implementation Plan (v1.2)

**Test 1: Load Testing**
```powershell
# scripts/load_test.ps1
- Concurrent: 10/50/100 parallel requests
- Duration: 1hr sustained load
- Measure: p50/p95/p99 latency, error rate, throughput
- Target: <1% error rate at 50 concurrent
```

**Test 2: Chaos Engineering**
```powershell
# scripts/chaos_test.ps1
- Kill main model (expect 100% embedder fallback)
- Kill embedder (expect graceful error responses)
- Network delays (expect timeout + retry)
- Disk full (expect log rotation to handle)
- Memory pressure (expect cache eviction)
```

**Test 3: Soak Test**
```powershell
# scripts/soak_test.ps1
- Run: 1000 requests over 24 hours
- Measure: memory leaks, file handle leaks, cache growth
- Target: <5% resource growth over 24hr
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Error rate <1% under 50 concurrent requests
- Graceful degradation on all chaos scenarios
- Zero crashes, all failures logged to provenance
- Recovery within 30s of chaos resolution

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Deliverable:** `STRESS_TEST_RESULTS.md` with error budgets

---

## Validation Item 3: Privacy & Threat Model

### Goal
Third-party security review and formal threat model documentation

### Implementation Plan (v1.3)

**Step 1: Data Flow Audit**
```
Document:
- Where user input enters system
- How it's stored (conv_id hashing, PII redaction)
- Where it's logged (provenance files)
- Who can access it (file permissions)
- How it's deleted (GDPR deletion API)
```

**Step 2: Threat Model**
```
Identify threats:
- PII leakage in logs (mitigation: auto-redaction)
- Conv_id correlation attack (mitigation: SHA-256 hashing)
- Log file exposure (mitigation: file permissions)
- Slack webhook leakage (mitigation: GitHub secrets)
- Model prompt injection (mitigation: input sanitization)
```

**Step 3: Penetration Testing**
```
Test:
- Attempt PII extraction from logs
- Attempt conv_id de-hashing
- Attempt prompt injection for data exfiltration
- Attempt log file manipulation
- Attempt secret extraction
```

**Step 4: External Review**
```
Submit to:
- OWASP ML Security checklist
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- Third-party security consultant (if available)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Data flow documented and reviewed
- Threat model with mitigations for all identified threats
- Penetration test passes (or issues documented + fixed)
- External review completed (or waived with justification)

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks  
**Deliverable:** `SECURITY_AUDIT.md` with threat model + test results

## Publication Strategy

### Pre-Publication (Current)
**Status:** Internal validation complete  
**Claims:** "Internally validated modular AI system with closed-loop evaluation"  
**Audience:** Personal use, GitHub portfolio, technical discussions

### Post-External-Validation (v2.0)
**Status:** External benchmarks + stress tests complete  
**Claims:** "Modular AI system with validated performance and resilience"  
**Audience:** Technical blog posts, conference talks, pre-prints

### Post-Peer-Review (v3.0)
**Status:** Academic peer review complete  
**Claims:** "Novel language-first routing paradigm with empirical validation"  
**Audience:** Academic publications, research citations

---

## Risk Management

### Claiming Too Much (Risk: Reputation)
**Mitigation:** Conservative framing, clear "validated internally" disclaimers

### Claiming Too Little (Risk: Obscurity)
**Mitigation:** Honest assessment doc shows what's real vs what needs work

### Data Without Context (Risk: Misinterpretation)
**Mitigation:** Always include test environment (LM Studio, 7B models, Windows)

## Current Validation State

| Component | Internal Validation | External Validation | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Modularity | ✅ Layer tests, swap tests | ⚠️ Need benchmark comparison | CLAIM: Proven internally |

| Memory (CARMA) | ✅ 100% recall@5 (10 cases) | ⚠️ Need LongBench | CLAIM: Working internally |
| Closed-loop | ✅ All components wired | ⚠️ Need A/B comparison | CLAIM: Operational |
| Operations | ✅ Runbooks, SLOs, CI/CD | ⚠️ Need stress test | CLAIM: Ready for deploy |
| Security | ✅ PII scan clean, deletion API | ⚠️ Need pen-test | CLAIM: Implemented |

## Recommended Claims (v1.0.0-prod)

### ✅ Safe to Claim:
1. "Modular AI system with swappable components (empirically tested)"
2. "Language-first routing with mathematical refinement (60/40 split stable)"
3. "Closed-loop evaluation infrastructure (provenance → hypotheses → adaptation)"
4. "Production-ready monitoring (CI/CD, SLO alerts, dashboard)"
5. "GDPR-compliant data deletion API (tested on internal logs)"

### ⚠️ Qualify Before Claiming:
1. "Faster than baseline" → Need external baseline comparison
2. "Better retrieval than X" → Need head-to-head vs X
3. "Scales to enterprise" → Need distributed deployment test
4. "Secure against attacks" → Need penetration testing
5. "Novel research contribution" → Need peer review

### 🚫 Don't Claim Yet:
1. Any specific performance improvements vs SOTA
2. Any scalability assertions beyond local deployment
3. Any security guarantees beyond "implemented best practices"

---

**Current stance: Ship v1.0.0-prod with conservative claims. Collect evidence. Broaden claims as validation accumulates.**

This is **good science** - you're not overselling, you're building credibility. 🎯
