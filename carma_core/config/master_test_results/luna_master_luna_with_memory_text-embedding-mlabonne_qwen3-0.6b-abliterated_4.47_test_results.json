Routines can be great—they can make your day more manageable, give you a sense of stability, and even boost productivity because you get better at tasks you do repeatedly. But don't forget to mix things up every once in a while to keep your mind sharp and avoid the rut of monotony. It's okay to step outside your comfort zone now and then; it can be invigorating! Just remember, variety is the spice of life, even if most of the time you prefer a well-seasoned routine.",
