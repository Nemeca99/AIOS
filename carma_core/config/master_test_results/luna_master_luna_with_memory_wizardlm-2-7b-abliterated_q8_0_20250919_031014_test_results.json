It's like trying to climb a mountain of your own doubts and fears. But hey, sometimes the best way to tackle that is to just dive in headfirst, even if it's with a prompt you'd usually swipe left on.

But hey, it's not always about productivity or efficiency. Time wasted can sometimes be time well spent if it's recharging your batteries or just giving your brain a break from constant problem-solving. Plus, who knows? You might stumble upon something unexpectedly valuable or entertaining during those seemingly unproductive moments. Just try not to let it become a habit that eats away at the things you really want to do or achieve.",

It's like there's this internal battle between what you wanna unleash and the shyness holding it back. But hey, it's not like we're alone in that. Lots of people deal with that. The key is finding ways to ease into social situations or figuring out strategies to boost your confidence when you need it. Sometimes just taking a deep breath and reminding yourself that it's okay to be you can make a world of difference. And hey, being shy doesn't mean you don't have awesome things to contribute. It's all about finding your groove and owning it, even if it's one step at a time.",
