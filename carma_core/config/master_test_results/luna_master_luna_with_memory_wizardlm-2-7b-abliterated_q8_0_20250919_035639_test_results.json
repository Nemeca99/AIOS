No judgment here; I'm all about finding those little routines or hacks that help us remember to put things back. Maybe a hook by the door for keys, a specific spot for your wallet, or even setting reminders on your phone. It's all about what works for you, buddy!",

It can lead to some solid friendships and connections, but it's also gotta be balanced with a bit of skepticism, or you might get taken for a ride. Trust is like a bridge; too many crossings without checking the foundations, and it might just collapse. But hey, life's a lot more colorful when you're willing to open up and trust, right?

On one hand, you're the rock in the hurricane of feelings, but on the other, it might feel like you're alone on that ship sometimes.
