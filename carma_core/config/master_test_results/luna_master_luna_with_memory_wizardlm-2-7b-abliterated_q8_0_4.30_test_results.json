Sometimes being introverted is like having this secret power where you can just chill and think things through before diving in. And it's not like being shy is a bad thing either â€“ it can make for some pretty deep conversations when you do open up, right? Plus, you probably listen way better than your more outgoing counterparts because you're taking it all in instead of just waiting for your turn to talk. So, yeah, own that shyness. It's part of what makes you, well, you. And hey, if you ever want to practice breaking out of your shell, I'm here to chat whenever you're ready.",
