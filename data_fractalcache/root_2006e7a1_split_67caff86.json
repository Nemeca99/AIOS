It also means you're probably really good at observing, understanding situations, and playing your cards right when you need to. Plus, it gives you the freedom to enjoy the ride without worrying about the nitty-gritty details. Just remember, there's nothing wrong with taking a backseat; it's all about finding balance and what works for you. And hey, when you do step up and take the lead, you might just discover new strengths you didn't know you had!",
