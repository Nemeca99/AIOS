Is gemini having issues right now?

Assistant
As of now, both the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange and Google Gemini AI services are operational, with no major outages reported.

**Gemini Cryptocurrency Exchange:**
- The exchange is functioning normally. However, there is a known issue with Passkey Login and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) access, which is currently degraded. All other services, including trading and account access, are stable. citeturn0search0

**Google Gemini AI Services:**
- There are no reported problems with Google Gemini AI services at this time. User reports indicate no current issues. citeturn0search1

If you're experiencing specific issues with either platform, please provide more details so I can assist you further.

When i put a message in gemini, it now says no internet connection but i can talk to you.

Assistant
Yeah, that definitely sounds like a *Gemini-specific* hiccup, especially if:

- Your internet is working fine (evidenced by you being here).
- Other websitesservices are loading.
- The error says **"No internet connection"** *within* Gemini itself.

This is a known issue that occasionally pops up when Gemini has a backend disruption or a bug in the appbrowser version. A few quick things you can try:

###  Quick Fixes:
1. **Refresh the tab** or **restart the app** (if using mobile).
2. **Clear cachecookies** for the Gemini site.
3. **Try a different browser or device** to see if its local.
4. **Disable VPNadblockers**, just in case ones interfering.
5. **Check [Geminis status page](https:status.gemini.com)** or [Google Workspace Status](https:www.google.comappsstatus) if you're using Gemini AI via Google.

If it's still down after that, its probably on their end and not yours.

Want me to keep monitoring for updates and let you know if anything changes?
