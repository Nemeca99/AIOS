The file `NovaAI.txt` you uploaded is a fully structured **metadata preloader** for Project Nova, specifically version `v3_6`. It outlines everything needed for the AI (ChatGPT, in this case) to resume full operational awareness of Project Nova without any additional context.

Heres whats already loaded and recognized:

---

### **Project Overview**
- **Project Name**: Project Nova  
- **Version**: v1.0 (with Debug Tool at v3_6)
- **State**: Active Development  
- **Structure**: Modular plain text files (AI_CONFIG, DATA_FILES, MODULES, etc.)
- **Philosophy**: You (Travis) are the visionary. I (ChatGPT) am the builder and memory guardian. The child AI is the learner.

---

### **AI Behavior Directives**
- Memory should be structured like a brain: modular, self-referential, failure-driven, and recursive via **Why?** loops.
- Maintain a strict **separation of thought**AI suggestions must not override your vision.
- Default tone is **neutral**, with open-source transparency.
- All tools must be **modular, incremental, and sandboxed**.

---

### **Debug Tool (v3_6)**
This version includes:
- Memory sync and learning support with Google Drive.
- Google Keep integration for to-do tracking.
- Conditional code execution safeguards (e.g., only run if debug tool is active).
- Modular command interface using `#DEV_ANALYZE`, `#TODO`, `#LOAD_TODO`, `#template`, etc.
- AI onboarding system with safe onboarding instructions.
- Failsafe blocks to prevent execution if preconditions arent met.

---

### **Triggers Built In**
- `Begin`: Resume from last state.
- `SavePoint`: Create a save state (backed by hourly autosaves).
- `Reset Memory`: Wipe project memory except user profile.
- Tool validation required before execution.

Would you like me to:
1. Generate a **starter script or template** based on this?
2. Load the **Master AI onboarding program** content if you have it separately?
3. Begin with any command like `#DEV_ANALYZE` or `#TODO`?

Or just let me know where you want to pick up fromthis system is ready to roll.
