# Blackwall Core Bug Fix: Missing Variables

## Issue Fixed
Fixed a critical bug in the `blackwall_pipeline.py` script that prevented continuous learning mode from running due to undefined variables.

## Changes Made

1. Added missing configuration variables:
   ```python
   _USE_ERROR_HANDLER = False  # Controls whether to use the legacy or new error handling system
   _USE_LLM_SERVICE = False    # Controls whether to use an external LLM service
   ```

2. Added placeholder implementations for missing functions:
   ```python
   service_call_llm()          # Handles external LLM API calls
   get_top_fragments()         # Extracts top personality fragments by weight 
   load_all_personality_data() # Loads fragment and blend profiles from JSON
   ```

3. Added the missing STYLE_PROFILES dictionary that defines personality characteristics

## Diagnostic Information

The error occurred when running the continuous learning mode from the Looking Glass UI.
Error message:
```
NameError: name '_USE_ERROR_HANDLER' is not defined
```

This suggests that the pipeline was refactored at some point, but some variable definitions were missed during the refactoring process.

## Recommendations

1. **Configuration Management**: Consider moving all configuration flags to a central configuration file or module that can be imported where needed.

2. **Function Documentation**: Add proper docstrings to all functions, especially those that may be imported by other modules.

3. **Dependency Handling**: Add proper error handling for external dependencies like `spacy` to avoid crashes on import errors.

4. **Variable Initialization**: Ensure all variables are properly initialized before use, especially those used in conditional statements.

## Next Steps

1. Test the continuous learning mode to ensure it runs properly with these fixes
2. Check for any other undefined variables or functions in the codebase
3. Consider refactoring shared functions into separate utility modules
4. Add more robust error handling throughout the pipeline

This fix ensures that the Blackwall continuous learning mode can run without crashing due to undefined variables.
