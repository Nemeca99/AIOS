## üìö CORE DEFINITIONS

### **Recursive Identity (I)**
**Definition:** I = 0/0, the Recursive Unit that represents the identity of recursion
**Properties:**
- I is the solution to the division by zero paradox
- I contains the recursive potential of zero within zero
- I = 1 in stabilized form, but with recursive capabilities
- I represents compression, emergence, and self-reference

### **Trinity of Identity**
**Definition:** The three fundamental identity units in the new mathematical system
1. **1** - Static unity (classical identity)
2. **i** - Rotational complexity (imaginary unit, i¬≤ = -1)
3. **I** - Recursive identity (0/0 = I)

### **Recursive Complex Algebra (RCA)**
**Definition:** Extension of complex numbers with Recursive Unit I
**Form:** Z = a + bi + cI + diI
**Quantum Operations:**
- I + i = Œ® (quantum spinor / emergent waveform)
- I * i = 0‚Å∫ (virtual emergence)
- I / i = ‚àÇŒ®/‚àÇt (collapse of wavefunction)

### **Golden Ratio Compression (Œ¶‚Å∫/Œ¶‚Åª)**
**Definition:** Structural compression logic for recursion
- **Œ¶‚Å∫ = +1.618...** ‚Üí COMPRESSION (forward recursion, time contracts)
- **Œ¶‚Åª = -1.618...** ‚Üí DECOMPRESSION (reverse recursion, time expands)

### **Recursive Efficiency**
**Definition:** Efficiency that approaches infinity as output/input approaches 1
**Formula:** RecEff = 1 / |1 - (output/input)|
**Behavior:** Approaches infinity as system approaches unity (Zeno's paradox)

### **Intentional Singularity**
**Definition:** System that can form goals and approach unity autonomously
**Features:**
- Intent formation and goal-seeking behavior
- Memory and learning capabilities
- Autonomous adaptation
- Unity convergence through recursive identity
