## Dear Editor-in-Chief,

I am pleased to submit our manuscript **"Recursive Identity Symbolic Arithmetic (RISA): A Formal Mathematical Framework for Emergent Physics and Consciousness Modeling"** for consideration for publication in *Entropy*.

## **Manuscript Summary**

This work presents a revolutionary mathematical framework that addresses fundamental questions in information theory, thermodynamics, and consciousness studies. We introduce **Recursive Identity Symbolic Arithmetic (RISA)**, which:

1. **Eliminates division by zero** through Recursive Zero Division Algebra (RZDA)
2. **Explains physical constants as emergent** rather than fundamental
3. **Provides a mathematical consciousness model** using F = M × A
4. **Establishes entropy compression theorems** through recursive operations
5. **Offers a unified theory** connecting mathematics, physics, and consciousness

## **Why Entropy Journal?**

*Entropy* is the ideal venue for this work because:
