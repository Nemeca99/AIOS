# UML Calculator Feature Comparison

## Comparing UML Core vs. Codex Web Calculator

| Feature | UML Core (uml_core.py) | Codex Web Calculator (codex_symbolic_core.py) | Recommendation |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Base Parsing** | Advanced bracket notation with dimensional interpretation | Basic bracket notation with simpler structure | Keep UML Core's advanced parsing |
| **Base-52 Encoding** | Complete (A-Z, a-z) with letter_to_number function | Complete (A-Z, a-z) with similar implementation | Either implementation works; UML Core's is more integrated |
| **Recursive Compression** | Implemented with iterations parameter and detailed documentation | Not directly implemented | Keep UML Core's implementation |
| **RIS Meta-Operator** | Full implementation with entropy-based collapse | Not implemented | Keep UML Core's implementation |
| **Superposition** | Implemented with entropy-based collapse | Not implemented | Keep UML Core's implementation |
| **Error Handling** | Comprehensive with fallbacks | Basic | Keep UML Core's error handling |
| **Magic Square Logic** | Extensive with validation, compression, TFID | Not implemented | Include core magic square validation in the calculator |
| **SI Prefixes** | Via symbolic_extensions | Directly implemented | Combine both implementations |
| **Vector/Matrix Operations** | Via symbolic_extensions | Basic implementation | Use the more comprehensive implementation from symbolic_extensions |
| **Number Theory** | Via symbolic_extensions | Basic implementation | Use symbolic_extensions' implementation |
| **Roman Numerals** | Not implemented | Has roman_to_int and int_to_roman | Consider adding Roman numeral support |
| **Set Theory** | Not implemented | Has set operations | Consider adding set theory operations |
| **Logic Operators** | Not implemented | Has AND, OR, NOT | Consider adding logic operators |
| **Date Handling** | Not implemented | Has date parsing and diff | Consider adding date handling if useful |
| **Custom Operator Registry** | Not implemented | Has CUSTOM_OPERATORS registry | Consider implementing operator registry for extensibility |

## UI Features Comparison

| Feature | UML Calculator GUI | Codex Web Calculator | Recommendation |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Mode Selection** | Standard, UML, RIS | Various tabs (Basic, Scientific, etc.) | Keep mode selection with clear visual indication |
| **History** | Implemented | Implemented | Keep history feature with clean UI |
| **Conversion Tools** | UML, Base52 | Base conversions | Keep all conversion tools |
| **Graphing** | Not implemented | Implemented | Consider adding graphing for advanced use cases |
| **Advanced Functions** | Placeholders | Various implementations | Complete advanced function implementations |
| **Step-by-Step Display** | Implemented | Implemented | Keep step-by-step with enhanced display |

## Missing Features to Consider Adding

1. **Roman Numeral Support**: Add conversion between decimal and Roman numerals
2. **Set Theory Operations**: Include union, intersection, and difference operations
3. **Logic Operators**: Add boolean algebra support (AND, OR, NOT)
4. **Date Handling**: Consider adding basic date calculation features
5. **Custom Operator Registry**: Implement a system for user-defined operators
6. **Enhanced Error Messages**: Provide more detailed error explanations with examples
7. **Enhanced Symbol Table**: Create a comprehensive help system for all operators
8. **Persistent Settings**: Save user preferences between sessions

## Features for Future Versions

1. **Graphing Capability**: Add function plotting for visual representation
2. **Export/Import**: Allow saving calculations and custom operators
3. **Function Definition**: Let users define their own functions
4. **Scripting Support**: Enable running simple scripts with UML/RIS operations
5. **Magic Square Generator**: Integrate the magic square solver into the calculator
6. **Tutorial Mode**: Guide users through UML/RIS concepts
7. **Theme Customization**: Allow users to adjust the visual appearance

## Integration Recommendations

1. Keep the robust core from `uml_core.py` as the foundation
2. Add missing features from `codex_symbolic_core.py` selectively
3. Ensure consistent error handling across all operations
4. Maintain the clear separation between core logic and UI
5. Document all operators and functions thoroughly
6. Implement comprehensive testing for all calculator modes
