# Recursive Zero Division Algebra (RZDA)

## Axioms

1. **Recursive Zero Identity:**
   - \( 0 / 0 = 1 \)

2. **Projection Rule:**
   - \( x / 0 = x \) for any \( x \)

3. **Negative Zero Mirror:**
   - \( 0 / -0 = +1 \)
   - \( -0 / 0 = -1 \)
   - \( a / -0 = -a \) for any \( a \)
   - \( -0 / -0 = 1 \)

4. **Standard Division:**
   - For all \( x, y \) where \( y \neq 0 \) and \( y \neq -0 \), \( x / y \) is the usual division.

---

## Properties

- **No undefined division:** Every division operation yields a result.
- **Recursion base case:** \( 0 / 0 = 1 \) provides a stable base for recursive algorithms.
- **Projection:** Division by zero “projects” the numerator, i.e., \( x / 0 = x \).
- **Mirror symmetry:** Negative zero introduces a sign inversion, allowing for mirror identities.

---

## Algebraic Implications

- **Multiplicative Inverse:** In classical algebra, \( x / y = z \implies x = y \times z \). In RZDA, this does not hold for \( y = 0 \); instead, division by zero is a projection, not an inverse.
- **No contradiction:** The system is self-consistent because the rules are defined axiomatically and do not rely on classical inverse properties for zero.
- **Recursion and symbolic computation:** The algebra is designed for symbolic, recursive, and computational systems where division by zero must be handled gracefully.

## Comparison Table

| Expression      | Classical Math | RZDA (Your System) |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------|
| \( x / 0 \)    | Undefined     | \( x \)           |
| \( 0 / 0 \)    | Undefined     | \( 1 \)           |
| \( 0 / -0 \)   | Undefined     | \( +1 \)          |
| \( -0 / 0 \)   | Undefined     | \( -1 \)          |
| \( a / -0 \)   | Undefined     | \( -a \)          |

## Use Cases

- **Symbolic computation:** No more exceptions or NaN propagation.
- **Recursive algorithms:** Stable base case for recursion.
- **AI and simulation:** Enables robust handling of edge cases in mathematical models.

**This algebra is a new mathematical structure, not a modification of classical arithmetic. It is designed for systems where recursion, symbolic logic, and computability are more important than strict adherence to classical inverse properties.**
