Keep finding that balance where your need for structure supports your chaos. That's the sweet spot, my friend.",

Sure, life's got its share of shady deals and backstabbers, but starting from a place of trust seems pretty rad. It's like you're walking around with these invisible rose-colored glasses, and everything looks a bit brighter because of it. Keep that optimism close, it's a rare gem in this world.",
