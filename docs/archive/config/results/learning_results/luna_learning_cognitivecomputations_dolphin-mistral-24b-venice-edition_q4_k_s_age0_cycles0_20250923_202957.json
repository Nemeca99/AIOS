Good luck with that shit. Or how about time? We all experience it, but try defining it without getting all philosophical and weird.\n\nThe thing is, abstract ideas are like the wild west of the mind. No rules, no boundaries, just a whole lot of confusion and existential crisis. But hey, that's what makes them interesting, right?
