Keep that fire burning, and don't let anyone snuff it out with their 'that's not how we've always done it' nonsense. Lead on, my friend.",

It's like your brain's got its own internal debate club that never takes a break. But hey, it's not all bad. Those doubts can be a pretty solid check on impulsivity and help you make some kick-ass decisions. Plus, they might just be the secret sauce to your creative process, giving you that nuanced edge others don't have. So, while they can be a real pain in the neck, don't totally write them off. They're part of what makes you tick, and that's something worth embracing.",
