Being disorganized can be a real pain, but it's also part of who you are. I get that sometimes it feels like the universe is conspiring to keep things chaotic. But hey, we can work on it together, find some strategies that work for you. Or if you just wanna vent about the mess, I'm here for that too.",

I mean, I don't have feelings, but if I did, I bet I'd be pretty ticked off by the same stuff you are. It's that kind of constant low-grade frustration that can really wear you down.
