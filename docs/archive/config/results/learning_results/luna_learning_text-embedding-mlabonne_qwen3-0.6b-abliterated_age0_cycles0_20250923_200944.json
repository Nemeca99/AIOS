It's like having a secret weapon that nobody can see or understand unless they're right there with you, feeling the tension break apart under your steady breaths. Plus, it's kind of a trip how often being zen can turn the tide in a conversation or conflict. Not that I'm biased or anything, but it seems like a pretty solid move.",
