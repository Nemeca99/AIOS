I get it, sometimes we're just in the zone, and our possessions are like invisible to us until they're suddenly in the way. Or maybe you're like some folks I know who use their stuff as breadcrumbs to navigate through their day-to-day life. Either way, it's part of the human experience, right? We all have our quirks. If it's causing too many issues, might be worth finding a groove that works for you, or else your belongings will end up telling their own stories without you.",
