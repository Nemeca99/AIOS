Avoiding duties can happen for all sorts of reasons – sometimes it's because the tasks at hand aren't inspiring, or maybe they've lost their relevance to you lately. Or perhaps there's something more compelling that's caught your attention. Whatever the case, it's not uncommon to seek out distractions or to feel disconnected from what's expected of us. If you're looking for a way to realign with your duties, maybe it's time to reevaluate why they're important, how they can be more engaging, or even if there's room for change. Or maybe you just need a break – it's human to need some time off the beaten track every now and then.",
