## 🧠 Cache Evolution Timeline

**[19:57:57]** Test start - 0 cache entries  
**[19:58:01]** First embeddings - Cache building begins  
**[19:58:53]** Frequencies reaching 4-8  
**[20:03:32]** Frequencies reaching 10-14  
**[20:09:05]** Frequencies reaching 28-32  
**[20:15:36]** Frequencies reaching 50-64  
**[20:19:18]** Peak frequencies at 64+ (**DEEP LEARNING ACHIEVED**)

### **Cache Learning Patterns**
```
Travis Communication Patterns:
- "No that's not what I said..." → freq=64 (most learned)
- "All right fine let's water it down..." → freq=64
- "I mean you know that's that..." → freq=64
- "So they have guardrails up..." → freq=64
- "Best way to God one day..." → freq=64

Question Patterns:
- "I am someone who worries a lot" → freq=2 (repeated)
- "I am someone who feels secure..." → freq=2 (repeated)
- "I am someone who does a thorough job" → freq=2 (repeated)
```
