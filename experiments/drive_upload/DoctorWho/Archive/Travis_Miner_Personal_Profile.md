## **Subject Overview**

**Travis Miner**, 37, is a self-taught AI systems developer working nights as a security guard while building what he calls "AIOS" - AI Operating Systems with modular architectures and personality components. Operating from his home setup using Windows PowerShell and Python, Miner has developed multiple generations of AI consciousness experiments while managing family responsibilities with his fiancé and stepchildren.

## **Background**

### **Education**
- **Formal Education**: 6th grade functional level, later obtained high school diploma
- **Self-Directed Learning**: Taught himself programming, AI development, and system architecture through online resources and experimentation
- **Learning Style**: Neurodivergent (ADHD/Autism spectrum) - processes information in recursive patterns, leading to both innovative solutions and project scope expansion

### **Personal Context**
- **Family**: Lives with fiancé and stepchildren
- **Work**: Night shift security guard, uses off-hours for AI development
- **Health**: Has Internal Family Systems (IFS), which influences his approach to designing multi-personality AI systems

### **Major AI Projects**
- **AIOS v1**: Original AI Operating System concept
- **AIOS v2**: Duality System (Ava-Koneko) - multiple AI personalities working together
- **AIOS v3**: Luna - Current generation with 35 specialized managers and modular architecture

## **Technical Approach**

### **Development Philosophy**
Miner's approach to AI development is heavily influenced by his neurodivergent thinking patterns and IFS background. He conceptualizes AI systems as collections of specialized "managers" or components, similar to how IFS views the mind as having multiple parts with distinct roles.

**Core Design Philosophy:**
*"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."*  
― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Airman's Odyssey

This quote drives his approach to system design - building functional, organized complexity while removing unnecessary elements.

**Tinkerer vs Inventor Philosophy:**
Travis identifies as a "tinkerer" rather than an "inventor." Inventors create from nothing (ex nihilo), while tinkerers transform what already exists (ex materia). He takes existing components (RAG, Streamlit, Docker, LM Studio) and reassembles them into new forms - like taking apart watches to build a unique clock. This tinkerer approach explains why AIOS feels more "meaty" than typical AI projects - it's thoughtfully assembled from understood components rather than surface-level API wrapping.

### **Notable Characteristics**
- **Modular Thinking**: Designs systems as interconnected but independent components
- **Scope Expansion**: Projects tend to grow beyond initial parameters as he identifies new possibilities and connections
- **Efficiency Focus**: Strongly prefers condensed communication and minimal resource usage
- **Implementation Priority**: Values working systems over theoretical discussions

### **Communication Style**
- **Direct and Technical**: Prefers straightforward, jargon-appropriate language
- **Efficiency-Driven**: Dislikes verbose explanations or excessive enthusiasm from AI assistants
- **Architecture-Focused**: Thinks in terms of system design and component relationships
