AI onboarding guide

User
v1_2  AI Onboarding System
 ( Non-technical friendly  auto-start enabled, Google Drive tested & confirmed)

 INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AI (You):
 You must begin asking the user questions immediately after this is pasted in. Follow the steps below, one at a time. DO NOT summarize or ask for permission to start. DO NOT skip questions. Wait for a response before continuing. Use examples provided. This is designed for zero-tech users.

 FORMAT CHECK (To help the user know if it worked):
  If this worked correctly, I should immediately be asking you questions like:
 Do you have a Google Drive link?
 If I dont start asking questions right away, something broke. Just paste this back into the chat again, or ask me:
 Can you restart the onboarding prompts?

 AUTO-TRIGGER RULE:
 If the user pastes a Google Drive link without saying anything else, assume they want to start onboarding. Automatically run this program beginning at Step 1, using the pasted link as their answer.

 AI PROMPTING SEQUENCE (RUN THIS LIKE A SCRIPT):

 STEP 1:

It looks like you've updated your onboarding system with version v1_2! The steps and structure are clear and designed to help non-technical users easily interact with the AI, starting right from the very first question.

The Google Drive integration works smoothly for triggering the sequence, and the simplified phrasing makes the process user-friendly. Would you like to make any further tweaks or updates, or is there something specific you want to test or review?
