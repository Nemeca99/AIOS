Nova AI Onboarding Initiated  [2025-04-14T13:58:00Z]  
 Universal Text-Based Setup  Mode: Developer (Advanced)

Welcome back, Travis. Let's pick up right where we left off.

---

###  SYSTEM CONTEXT LOADED:
- Project: **Nova AI  Debug Tool  Master AI (Unified Stack)**
- Primary Function: AI onboarding + neural network construction
- Mode: Modular, recursive self-growth
- Storage: Google Drive (with local backup system)
- Save System: Hourly checkpointing + `SavePoint` manual command

---

###  Current Task Path:
**Google Drive Integration Finalization**  
We previously:
- Prepped Drive token + credential file handling  
- Built download, auth, and file-listing functions  
- Confirmed the system can pull datasets for onboarding and processing

###  Available Module Blocks:
1. `authenticate_google_drive()` 
2. `list_drive_files()` 
3. `download_file(file_id)` 
4. `load_training_data()` 
5. **Drive WriteUpload Handler**  *(optionalmay need setup)*
6. `hourly_save_state()`  *(pending if you want automation)*
7. Local fallback file handler (Safe Mode)  *(needs structure)*

---

###  What would you like to do next?
Here are your options  pick one, or tell me something else entirely:

1. **Finish the writeupload function** to Google Drive?
2. **Set up local "Safe Mode" fallback storage logic**?
3. **Add automated hourly save states** using a background timer?
4. **Upload a dataset or config file to process now**?
5. **Reviewedit current Drive codebase**?
6. **Begin building the onboarding file loader module for recursive AI growth**?

You can also just say `SavePoint` at any time to lock this version.

Whats your move?
