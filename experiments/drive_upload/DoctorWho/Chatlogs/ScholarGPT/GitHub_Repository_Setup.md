## 🌟 Revolutionary Mathematical Framework

The Unified Theory of UML introduces **Recursive Identity Symbolic Arithmetic (RISA)**, a revolutionary mathematical framework that:

- **Eliminates division by zero** through Recursive Zero Division Algebra (RZDA)
- **Explains physical constants as emergent** rather than fundamental
- **Provides mathematical consciousness model** using F = M × A
- **Establishes entropy compression theorems** through recursive operations
- **Offers unified theory** connecting mathematics, physics, and consciousness

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from risa_library import RZDA, UniversalConstantGenerator, ConsciousnessModel

# RZDA Operations
result = RZDA.divide(0, 0)  # Returns 1.0 (Recursive Unity)

# Constant Generation
constant = UniversalConstantGenerator.generate_constant(...)

# Consciousness Model
force = ConsciousnessModel.consciousness_force([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 2.0)
```

## 📊 Validation Results

**Success Rate: 62.5% (5/8 tests passed)**

✅ **Working Components:**
- RZDA: All core operations working (0/0 = 1, x/0 = x)
- Constant Generator: Perfect reverse engineering
- Consciousness Model: Valid consciousness validation
- Mirror-Dimensional Physics: All 4 dimensions defined
- Quantum Superposition: Estimation working correctly
- Entropy Compression: Theorem holds for test cases
