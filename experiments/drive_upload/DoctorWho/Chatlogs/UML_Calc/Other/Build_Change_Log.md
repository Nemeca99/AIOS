# Lyra Blackwall v2 â€” Build & Change Log

---

## Major Milestones
- Initial project structure and /root/ body-part metaphor modules scaffolded
- Core brain system split into brainstem, Left_Hemisphere (STM), Right_Hemisphere (LTM)
- All body modules (anchor, body, ears, eyes, hands, heart, lungs, mirror, mouth, nerves, shield, skin, soul, spine) scaffolded
- Migration of essential files from previous system to /migrate/
- Created /fusion/, /copilot/, /sandbox/, /tests/ for modular/future-proof architecture
- Advanced copilot protocol and recursive resilience instructions added
- Central event loop (heart.py) and fusion stub (fusion/lyra.py) created

## Build & Migration History
- See SYSTEMS_SUMMARY.md for technical blueprint and architecture
- See LLM_Discord_Requirements_Readme_Hardwareinfo.md for requirements and setup

---

## Recent Changes (June 2025)
- All core modules and folders created and scaffolded
- Documentation, requirements, and guides condensed and cross-referenced
- Copilot instructions updated for advanced protocol and resilience
- All redundant or legacy documentation merged or archived

# Lyra Blackwall v2 - Build Change Log

## June 19, 2025

### Initial Architecture & File Structure Setup

- Created overall project structure with `/root/` directory for core modules
- Established "body parts" metaphor for system architecture
- Created comprehensive placeholders for all core modules

### Core Module Scaffolding

#### Brain System

- Separated brain functionality into three components:
  - `brainstem.py`: Central LLM interface and orchestration
  - `Left_Hemisphere.py`: Short-term memory handling  - `Right_Hemisphere.py`: Long-term memory handling
- Implemented basic class structures with placeholder methods
- Fixed import errors in modules

#### Body Part Modules

The following modules have been scaffolded with basic class structures:

- `anchor.py` - Architect tether and verification system
- `body.py` - Main hub and signal carrier (bloodstream)
- `ears.py` - Audio input processing
- `eyes.py` - Visual/perceptual input processing
- `hands.py` - Action execution system
- `heart.py` - Core timing and autonomous loop driver
- `lungs.py` - Interface/buffer for external connections
- `mirror.py` - Self-reflection and introspection system
- `mouth.py` - Output generation and delivery
- `nerves.py` - Event bus and message passing
- `shield.py` - Defense and threat detection
- `skin.py` - System boundaries and security
- `soul.py` - Identity anchor and verification
- `spine.py` - Resilience and fallback routines

### Migration Progress

- Created `/migrate/` directory
- Successfully migrated all essential files from previous system for integration
- Files include documentation, configuration, utilities, and core logic components

### Next Steps

- Implement detailed functionality in each module
- Establish inter-module communication
- Develop the central event loop through the heart module
- Integrate migrated functionality into new architecture
