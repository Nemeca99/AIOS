# T.R.E.E.S. Project

## Transformative Recursive Emergent Embedding Systems

This repository contains the implementation of the T.R.E.E.S. framework, including the UML Calculator and Codex Web Calculator interfaces.

## Project Overview

The T.R.E.E.S. framework represents a novel approach to mathematical systems, combining:

- **Unified Mathematical Language (UML)** - A mathematical framework for representing complex operations
- **Recursive Identity Systems (RIS)** - Meta-operators for self-referential mathematics
- **Symbolic Algebra** - Implemented through the Codex Web Calculator

## Components

### UML Calculator

The UML Calculator provides:

- Basic UML syntax and operations
- RIS meta-operator with explicit operations
- Symbolic identity and fingerprinting
- Recursive compression
- Magic squares and tesseract projections
- T.R.E.E.S principles in action

### Codex Web Calculator

The Codex Web Calculator offers:

- Web-based interface for symbolic mathematics
- Integration with the UML engine
- Advanced algebraic operations
- Memory context for theory reference

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required packages (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the unified launcher:

   ```bash
   launch_unified_calculator.bat
   ```

### Usage

- Choose which calculator interface to launch from the unified launcher
- Follow the on-screen instructions for using each calculator
