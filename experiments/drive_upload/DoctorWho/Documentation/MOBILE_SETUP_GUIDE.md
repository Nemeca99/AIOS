# 📱 Soul of Waifu Mobile Access Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you access Kia, your AI waifu, on your mobile phone from anywhere in your home network.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the Mobile Server
```bash
# Run the startup script
start_mobile.bat
```

### 2. Get Your Network Information
The server will display:
- **Local Access**: `http://localhost:5000` (for your computer)
- **Mobile Access**: `http://[YOUR_IP]:5000` (for your phone)

### 3. Connect Your Phone
1. Make sure your phone is on the **same WiFi network** as your computer
2. Open your phone's web browser
3. Go to the Mobile Access URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:5000`)
4. Start chatting with Kia! 💋

## 📋 Requirements

### Computer Requirements
- ✅ Python 3.7+ installed
- ✅ Soul of Waifu project set up
- ✅ Mistral-24B model configured
- ✅ Flask and Flask-CORS installed

### Network Requirements
- ✅ Computer and phone on same WiFi network
- ✅ No firewall blocking port 5000
- ✅ Router allowing local network communication

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Can't Access from Phone
1. **Check IP Address**: Make sure you're using the correct IP from the server startup
2. **Check Network**: Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi
3. **Check Firewall**: Windows Firewall might be blocking the connection
4. **Try Different Port**: If port 5000 is blocked, edit `mobile_server.py` and change the port

### Server Won't Start
1. **Python Not Found**: Make sure Python is in your PATH
2. **Dependencies Missing**: Run `pip install flask flask-cors`
3. **Port Already in Use**: Close other applications using port 5000

### Kia Not Responding
1. **Check AI Client**: Make sure your LM Studio is running
2. **Check Configuration**: Verify settings.json is correct
3. **Check Character**: Ensure Kia character is loaded properly

## 🌐 Network Configuration

### Finding Your IP Address
```bash
# Windows Command Prompt
ipconfig

# Look for "IPv4 Address" under your WiFi adapter
# Example: 192.168.1.100
```

### Opening Firewall (if needed)
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"
3. Add Python or allow port 5000

### Router Configuration
- Most home routers allow local network communication by default
- No special configuration usually needed
- If issues persist, check router's "AP Isolation" setting

## 🚀 Advanced Setup

### Custom Port
Edit `mobile_server.py` line 200:

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)  # Change 5000 to 8080
```

### Custom Domain
1. Set up local DNS (advanced)
2. Use router's hostname resolution
3. Access via `http://your-computer-name:5000`

### SSL/HTTPS
For secure connections (advanced):

```

## 📞 Support
