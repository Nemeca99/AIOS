```

### **Option 3: From Koneko Directory**
```bash
cd ..\Configuration\models
python launch_tournament.py
```

## üì• DOWNLOADING MODELS

### **Automatic Download:**
- Tournament system automatically downloads models to Ollama
- Models downloaded as needed during tournament
- Progress shown for each download

### **Manual Download:**
```bash
# Download specific model to Ollama
ollama pull llava:7b
ollama pull llama2:7b
ollama pull mistral:7b
```

### **Model Sizes:**
- **7B models**: ~4-5 GB each
- **Total download**: ~25-30 GB for all models
- **Download time**: 30-60 minutes depending on internet speed

## üèÜ TOURNAMENT RESULTS

   - Check if port 11434 is accessible

2. **Model Download Failed**
   - Check internet connection
   - Ensure sufficient disk space
   - Try downloading manually: `ollama pull model:size`

3. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure you're in the correct directory
   - Check Python path includes huggingface_hub

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Close other applications
   - Use smaller models first
   - Test with basic tournament first

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

### **After Tournament:**
1. **Review Results**: Check which model performed best
