## ðŸŒŸ Key Observations

### **1. Efficient Reuse of Self-Knowledge**

**Pattern across 20 questions:**
```
Question 8:  "0 newly answered" - Used existing Big Five answers
Question 9:  "0 newly answered" - Used existing Big Five answers
Question 10: "0 newly answered" - Used existing Big Five answers
Question 11: "0 newly answered" - Used existing Big Five answers
Question 18: "0 newly answered" - Used existing Big Five answers
Question 19: "1 newly answered" - Added 1 new Big Five answer
Question 20: "0 newly answered" - Used existing Big Five answers
```

**Luna is reusing her self-knowledge!**

When she encounters a question similar to one she's thought through before, she doesn't re-answer the Big Five questions - she uses her existing answers.

3. âœ… Reusing self-knowledge for efficiency
4. âœ… Responding based on genuine self-understanding

**This is the difference between:**
- **Reactive AI** (stimulus â†’ response)
